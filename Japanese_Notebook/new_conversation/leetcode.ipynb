I tried these briefly after the interview, but they didn’t seem effective.\n",

The behavioral interview was quick, but the interviewer seemed satisfied. I walked through a solid design for the system architecture question, discussed all tradeoffs, and incorporated the interviewer’s suggestions for improvement."
