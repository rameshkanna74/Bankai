    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Total Chalk Usage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `total_chalk = sum(chalk)`: Compute the total amount of chalk required for one full cycle of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Determine Remaining Chalk**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `remaining_chalk = k % total_chalk`: Calculate the remaining chalk after using as many full cycles as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find the Replacing Student**:\n",
    "   - Iterate over the `chalk` list while accumulating the chalk usage. When the accumulated chalk exceeds the remaining chalk, the current index represents the student who will need to replace the chalk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of students. This is due to iterating through the `chalk` list twice: once to calculate the total and once to find the replacing student.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python solution efficiently handles the problem within the given constraints and mirrors the logic used in the Rust code.\n"
