    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `s_index` starts at the beginning of `s`.\n",
    "   - `t_index` starts at the beginning of `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Traversal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - As you iterate through `t`, if `s[s_index]` matches `t[t_index]`, move the `s_index` forward.\n",
    "   - Always move the `t_index` forward, regardless of whether there's a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Completion**:\n",
    "   - If `s_index` reaches the end of `s`, it means all characters in `s` were found in `t` in the correct order, so return `True`.\n",
    "   - If the loop ends and `s_index` hasn't reached the end of `s`, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `t`. This is because each string is traversed at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(1)**, as no additional space is used apart from a few variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Follow-up Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to check multiple strings (`s1, s2, ..., sk`) against the same string `t`, with `k >= 10^9`, the solution needs to be highly efficient. Here are some approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing with Hash Maps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Idea**: Preprocess `t` to create a dictionary where each key is a character, and the value is a list of indices in `t` where that character occurs. This allows for faster lookups when checking if `s` is a subsequence.\n",
    "   - **Implementation**:\n",
    "     - Build the dictionary in O(m) time.\n",
    "     - For each `s`, use binary search to check if each character in `s` can be found in `t` after the previous character's index.\n",
    "     - This approach significantly reduces the time required for each subsequence check.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search for Faster Matching**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import bisect\n",
    "\n",
    "   def preprocess(t: str):\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",

    "       \"\"\"\n",

    "       for index, char in enumerate(t):\n",
    "           if char not in char_map:\n",
    "               char_map[char] = []\n",
    "           char_map[char].append(index)\n",
    "       return char_map\n",
    "\n",
    "   def isSubsequenceWithPreprocessing(s: str, char_map) -> bool:\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       Use the preprocessed map to check if 's' is a subsequence of 't'.\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       prev_index = -1\n",
    "       for char in s:\n",
    "           if char not in char_map:\n",
    "               return False\n",
    "           # Find the next occurrence of char in t using binary search\n",
    "           pos = bisect.bisect_right(char_map[char], prev_index)\n",
    "           if pos >= len(char_map[char]):\n",
    "               return False\n",
    "           prev_index = char_map[char][pos]\n",
    "       return True\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Example usage\n",
    "   t = \"ahbgdc\"\n",
    "   char_map = preprocess(t)\n",
    "   example1 = \"abc\"\n",
    "   example2 = \"axc\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(isSubsequenceWithPreprocessing(example1, char_map))  # Output: True\n",
    "   print(isSubsequenceWithPreprocessing(example2, char_map))  # Output: False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - `preprocess(t)` constructs a map where each character in `t` points to a list of its indices.\n",
    "     - `isSubsequenceWithPreprocessing(s, char_map)` uses binary search to efficiently determine if `s` is a subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Preprocessing**: O(m)\n",
    "     - **Checking each s**: O(n log m)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "     - O(m) for storing the indices map.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing approach is particularly effective when `t` is large, and many subsequence checks need to be performed.\n"
