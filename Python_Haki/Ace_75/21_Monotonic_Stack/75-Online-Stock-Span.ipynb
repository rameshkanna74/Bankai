        "The goal is to design an algorithm that collects daily stock prices and computes the span of each stock's price. The span of the price on a given day is defined as the number of consecutive days (starting from the current day and going backwards) where the price is less than or equal to the current day's price.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Key Insights:\n",
        "1. **Stack Data Structure**: The problem can be solved efficiently using a stack to keep track of the indices of the stock prices. The stack helps us efficiently find the span of each day's price by maintaining a decreasing order of stock prices from the most recent to the past prices.\n",
        "2. **Greedy Strategy**: For each new price, we pop from the stack until we find a price that is greater than or equal to the current price, at which point the span is the difference between the current index and the index of the price found in the stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Algorithm:\n",
        "1. For each price, if the stack is empty or the current price is less than the price at the top of the stack, we push the current index onto the stack and return a span of 1.\n",
        "2. If the current price is greater than the price at the top of the stack, we pop the stack, counting how many previous prices are less than or equal to the current price. The span is the difference between the current day and the last popped day's index.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** per `next()` call on average, making the total complexity **O(n)** for `n` calls to `next()`. This is because each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of calls to `next()`, as we store the indices of the prices in the stack.\n",
