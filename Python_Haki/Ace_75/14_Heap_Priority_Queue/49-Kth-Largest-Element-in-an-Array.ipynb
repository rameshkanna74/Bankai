        "- **Quickselect Algorithm**: This is an optimal algorithm that works similar to quicksort but only partially sorts the array to find the `k`th largest (or smallest) element. It operates in average linear time, `O(n)`.\n",
        "- **Partitioning**: The idea behind Quickselect is to partition the array around a pivot such that:\n",
        "  - Elements greater than the pivot are on one side, and elements less than the pivot are on the other side.\n",
        "  - After partitioning, we know that the pivot is in its correct position.\n",

        "### **Algorithm Design**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Quickselect**:\n",
        "   - The core of the solution is based on the Quickselect algorithm, which is a variant of Quicksort.\n",
        "   - In Quickselect, we choose a pivot and partition the array such that elements greater than the pivot are on one side, and elements smaller than the pivot are on the other side.\n",
        "   - If the pivot is at the `k`th position (0-indexed), then weâ€™ve found our answer.\n",

        "2. **Time Complexity**:\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Space Complexity**:\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Partitioning**:\n",
        "   - We select a random pivot to improve performance in practice, avoiding worst-case performance (which occurs when the pivot is poorly chosen).\n",
        "   - The array is rearranged such that all elements greater than or equal to the pivot are on the left side, and the pivot itself is placed in the correct sorted position.\n",
        "4. **Choosing the Next Search Space**:\n",
        "   - If the pivot is in the correct position (equal to `k`), we return it.\n",
