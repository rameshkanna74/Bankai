        "You are given two integer arrays: `spells` and `potions`. A pair of spell and potion is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least the given `success` value. For each spell in the `spells` array, you need to return the number of potions that form a successful pair with that spell.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "The brute-force approach would be to check each spell and each potion, resulting in a time complexity of `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the length of `spells` and `m` is the length of `potions`. Given that `n` and `m` can each be as large as `10^5`, this approach could be too slow.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Sorting**:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Binary Search**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For each spell `spell[i]`, we want to find how many potions in the sorted `potions` array satisfy the condition: `spell[i] * potion[j] >= success`. This can be transformed into: `potion[j] >= success / spell[i]`.\n",
        "   - Using binary search, we can find the first potion in the sorted array that meets this condition. The number of successful pairs for `spell[i]` is then the number of elements from this position to the end of the `potions` array.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Time Complexity**:\n",
        "   - Sorting the `potions` array takes `O(m log m)`.\n",
        "   - For each spell, performing a binary search on the `potions` array takes `O(log m)`. Doing this for `n` spells results in a total time complexity of `O(n log m)`.\n",

        "1. **Sorting the Potions Array**:\n",

        "   - We sort the `potions` array in ascending order, so that we can use binary search to efficiently find the first valid potion for each spell.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Binary Search**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For each spell, we need to find the smallest potion `p` such that `spell[i] * p >= success`. This is equivalent to finding the smallest `p >= success / spell[i]`. We use binary search to find this index.\n",
        "   - The `binary_search` function returns the index of the first potion that satisfies this condition, and the number of successful pairs is the number of elements from this index to the end of the `potions` array.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Iterating Through Spells**:\n",
        "   - We iterate over each spell in the `spells` array, apply the binary search on the sorted `potions` array, and calculate how many potions will form a successful pair with that spell. This result is collected into a vector and returned.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Sorting the `potions` array takes `O(m log m)`, where `m` is the length of `potions`.\n",
        "  - For each spell, we perform a binary search on the `potions` array, which takes `O(log m)` time. Since there are `n` spells, this step takes `O(n log m)`.\n",
        "  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(m log m + n log m)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
        "  - We use `O(m)` extra space to store the sorted `potions` array.\n",
        "  - Other space usage is minimal, so the overall space complexity is `O(m)`.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Edge Cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **All Spells are Small**: If all spells are small, some potions might never form a successful pair with them. The binary search will efficiently handle this case by returning `0` pairs.\n",
        "2. **All Potions are Small**: If all potions are small, only a few spells might succeed in forming successful pairs.\n",
        "3. **Success is Larger Than the Maximum Possible Product**: If `success` is larger than the product of the largest spell and potion, the binary search will return `0` pairs for all spells.\n",
        "4. **Success Equals Product of Spell and Potion**: The binary search correctly identifies the exact threshold where a potion becomes successful.\n",
