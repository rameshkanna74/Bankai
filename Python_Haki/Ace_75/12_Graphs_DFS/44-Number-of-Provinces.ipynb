A province is defined as a group of cities that are directly or indirectly connected.\n",

        "2. **Time Complexity**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Each city and connection (i.e., edge) is processed at most once. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of cities. This is optimal because we need to examine all possible connections in the matrix.\n",
