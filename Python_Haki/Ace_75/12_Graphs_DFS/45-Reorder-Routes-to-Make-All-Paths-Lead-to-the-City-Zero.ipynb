        "\n",
        "- **Graph Representation**: The cities and roads form an undirected tree. Each city is a node, and each road is an edge between two nodes.\n",
        "- **DFS or BFS**: These graph traversal techniques can help us explore all cities while counting how many edges need to be reversed. We need to track roads where the direction needs to be flipped so that we can make sure every city can reach city `0`.\n",

        "### **Algorithm Design**\n",

        "3. **Time Complexity**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The graph traversal (DFS or BFS) takes `O(n)` time since we visit each node and edge once. The input guarantees that there are exactly `n - 1` edges, so the time complexity is linear with respect to the number of cities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Space Complexity**:\n",

        "1. **Graph Construction**:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **DFS Traversal**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The `dfs` function is a standard depth-first search. It marks the city as visited and traverses each connected city. If the direction of the edge is from the city to the neighboring city (i.e., it points towards `0`), we don't need to reverse the road, but if it points away, we increment the counter of reversed roads.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Return**:\n",
        "   - The function returns the number of roads that need to be reversed to ensure every city can reach city `0`.\n",

        "### **Time Complexity Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`\n",
        "  - We traverse each node and edge exactly once. Since there are `n-1` edges in a tree, the total number of operations is linear with respect to the number of nodes (cities).\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`\n",
        "  - We use an adjacency list (`graph`) to store the tree, which takes `O(n)` space, and an additional `visited` array of size `n` to track visited cities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Edge Case Considerations**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Minimum Input**: The smallest tree with `n = 2` will be handled correctly. There's only one road and it will either need to be reversed or not.\n",
        "- **All Roads Already Pointing Towards City 0**: In this case, no roads need to be reversed, and the function will return `0`.\n",
