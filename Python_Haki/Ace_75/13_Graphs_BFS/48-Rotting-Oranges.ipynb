        "### **Explanation of the Code**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Grid Initialization**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The grid is copied into a mutable variable `grid` for modification during BFS.\n",
        "   - The grid dimensions are captured by `rows` and `cols`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **BFS Setup**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A queue (`VecDeque`) is used to simulate the BFS. The queue stores the positions of the rotten oranges along with the current minute count (`(r, c, time)`).\n",
        "   - The grid is iterated over to find all the initial rotten oranges (value `2`), which are added to the queue. Additionally, we count the number of fresh oranges (`1`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **BFS Process**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For each rotten orange, we explore its 4 adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n",
        "   - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange (`1`), it becomes rotten, the fresh orange count is decremented, and the rotten orange is added to the queue with an incremented time.\n",
        "   - The maximum time taken for any fresh orange to rot is tracked using `max_time`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Termination**:\n",
        "   - After BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left (`fresh_oranges > 0`), it means some oranges couldn't be rotted (because they are isolated), so we return `-1`.\n",
        "   - Otherwise, we return the `max_time`, which is the number of minutes taken for all reachable fresh oranges to rot.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Time Complexity Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
        "  - The BFS processes each cell in the grid at most once, so the time complexity is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
        "  - The space complexity is `O(m * n)` because the queue stores the positions of rotten oranges, and the grid itself is used for marking visited cells.\n",
