The entrance itself cannot be counted as an exit.\n",

        "- **Graph Representation**: The maze can be considered as an unweighted graph where each cell is a node, and edges exist between adjacent empty cells.\n",
        "- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid or graph. By exploring the grid layer by layer, BFS guarantees that we visit nodes in increasing distance from the source.\n",

        "   - If the entrance is surrounded by walls or there are no exits, return `-1`.\n",

        "### **Explanation of the Code**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **BFS Initialization**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - We use a queue (`VecDeque`) to store cells that need to be processed. Each entry contains the current row, column, and the distance from the entrance.\n",
        "   - The entrance cell is marked as visited by changing it to `'+'` so that we don't visit it again.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Main BFS Loop**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For each cell in the queue, we check if it's an exit (i.e., it's an empty cell on the border of the maze).\n",
        "   - If it's an exit, we return the current distance.\n",
        "   - If it's not an exit, we explore its 4 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). If a neighboring cell is valid (within bounds and not a wall), it is added to the queue and marked as visited.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Edge Case Handling**:\n",
        "   - The entrance itself is not considered an exit, so we only return the distance once we encounter a valid exit cell.\n",
        "   - If no path leads to an exit, we return `-1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Time Complexity Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
        "  - **BFS** processes each cell at most once. Since the maze has `m * n` cells, the time complexity is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
        "  - The space complexity is `O(m * n)` because we store each cell in the maze in the queue and the visited state is modified in-place.\n",
