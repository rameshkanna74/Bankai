    "        if nums[current_position] != val:\n",
    "            nums[next_position] = nums[current_position]\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. We perform a single pass through the array.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The operation is done in place without using any additional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "1. **`next_position`**: This pointer keeps track of where the next element that isn't equal to `val` should be placed in the array.\n",
    "2. **Loop through the array**: \n",
    "   - If the current element (`nums[current_position]`) is not equal to `val`, it's copied to the position indicated by `next_position`.\n",
    "   - The `next_position` pointer is then incremented to move to the next position.\n",
    "3. **Return Value**: After the loop completes, `next_position` contains the number of elements in the array that are not equal to `val`. The first `next_position` elements in `nums` will be the elements that were kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the array is modified in place with the best possible time and space efficiency."
