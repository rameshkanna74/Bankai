    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We start by initializing `total_tank` and `current_tank` to 0. `total_tank` keeps track of the overall gas balance, and `current_tank` tracks the gas balance starting from the current potential starting station.\n",
    "   - `start_station` is initialized to 0, which is our starting index candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Traversing the Stations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each station `i`, we calculate the net gas remaining after considering the gas available at the station and the gas required to move to the next station. This is done by `total_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]` and `current_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]`.\n",
    "   - If `current_tank` becomes negative, it means the car cannot move forward starting from the current `start_station`, so we update `start_station` to `i + 1` and reset `current_tank` to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Decision**:\n",
    "   - If the `total_tank` is non-negative after the loop, the circuit can be completed starting from `start_station`. If `total_tank` is negative, it's impossible to complete the circuit, so we return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we only make one pass through the gas and cost arrays.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`, the function returns `3` because starting from station 3 allows you to complete the circuit.\n",
    "- For `gas = [2, 3, 4]` and `cost = [3, 4, 3]`, the function returns `-1` because no starting point allows you to complete the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is optimal for the problem, meeting the constraints effectively.\n"
