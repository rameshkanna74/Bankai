    "To solve this problem, we need to identify customers who visited the mall but did not make any transactions. We also need to count the number of visits for each of these customers where no transactions were made.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Visits Without Transactions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We will identify which `visit_id` entries from the `Visits` table have no corresponding entries in the `Transactions` table. This means that no transaction was made during that visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Count Visits per Customer**:\n",
    "   - Once we identify the visits without transactions, we need to count how many such visits each customer had.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Step 1: Identify customers who visited but did not make any transactions\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    V.customer_id,       -- Select the customer_id from Visits table\n",
    "    COUNT(V.visit_id) AS count_no_trans  -- Count the number of visits with no transactions\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    Visits V\n",
    "LEFT JOIN\n",
    "    Transactions T ON V.visit_id = T.visit_id  -- Left join to include all visits, including those with no transactions\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    T.visit_id IS NULL  -- Only include visits with no transactions (visit_id in Transactions table is NULL)\n",
    "GROUP BY\n",
    "    V.customer_id       -- Group by customer_id to get the count of visits without transactions per customer\n",
    "ORDER BY\n",
    "    V.customer_id;      -- Optionally, order the result by customer_id (this is not required by the problem)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LEFT JOIN**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We use a `LEFT JOIN` to include all visits from the `Visits` table, whether or not they have a corresponding transaction in the `Transactions` table.\n",
    "   - If a visit has no matching entry in the `Transactions` table, the `visit_id` in the `Transactions` table will be `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **WHERE T.visit_id IS NULL**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This condition filters the results to only include those visits that did not have any transactions. If there was no transaction, the `visit_id` in the `Transactions` table is `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **COUNT(V.visit_id)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each customer, we count how many visits did not result in a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY V.customer_id**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This groups the results by `customer_id`, so we get a count of visits without transactions for each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **ORDER BY V.customer_id**:\n",
    "   - This ensures that the result is ordered by `customer_id`, but the order of the results is not important per the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M), where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - N is the number of rows in the `Visits` table.\n",
    "  - M is the number of rows in the `Transactions` table.\n",
    "  - The query performs a `LEFT JOIN`, which involves scanning both tables and matching rows. We then filter for `NULL` values and perform a `GROUP BY` operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(N), as we are grouping by `customer_id` and counting the number of visits. The space complexity mainly depends on the number of distinct `customer_id`s in the `Visits` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Case Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create and Populate Tables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create Visits table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Visits (\n",
    "    visit_id INT,\n",

    "\n",
    "-- Create Transactions table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Transactions (\n",
    "    transaction_id INT,\n",
    "    visit_id INT,\n",
    "    amount INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert data into Transactions table\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Transactions;\n",
    "INSERT INTO Transactions (transaction_id, visit_id, amount) VALUES\n",
    "(2, 5, 310),\n",
    "(3, 5, 300),\n",
    "(9, 5, 200),\n",
    "(12, 1, 910),\n",
    "(13, 2, 970);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Execute the Query**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Execute the query to find customers with visits but no transactions\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    V.customer_id,       -- Customer ID\n",
    "    COUNT(V.visit_id) AS count_no_trans  -- Number of visits without transactions\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    Visits V\n",
    "LEFT JOIN\n",
    "    Transactions T ON V.visit_id = T.visit_id\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    T.visit_id IS NULL  -- Only visits with no transactions\n",
    "GROUP BY\n",
    "    V.customer_id       -- Group by customer_id\n",
    "ORDER BY\n",
    "    V.customer_id;      -- Optionally, order by customer_id\n",
    "```\n",
