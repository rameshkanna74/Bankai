    "### Problem Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to find all the `id` values from the `Weather` table where the temperature on a particular `recordDate` is higher than the temperature on the previous day (yesterday).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self Join on the Weather Table**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We can achieve this by performing a **self join** on the `Weather` table. We join the table to itself on the condition that the `recordDate` of one row is exactly one day after the `recordDate` of another row.\n",
    "   - Specifically, we join on `w1.recordDate = w2.recordDate + INTERVAL '1 day'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filter on Temperature Comparison**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each pair of consecutive days, we filter out those where the temperature of the current day (`w2.temperature`) is greater than the previous day's temperature (`w1.temperature`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the `id` of the Current Day**:\n",
    "   - If the temperature of the current day is higher than the previous day, we return the `id` of the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Step 1: Join the Weather table to itself to compare consecutive days\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    w2.id  -- Select the id of the current day where the temperature is higher than the previous day\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    Weather w1  -- Alias for the previous day\n",
    "JOIN\n",
    "    Weather w2  -- Alias for the current day\n",
    "ON\n",
    "    w1.recordDate = w2.recordDate - INTERVAL '1 day'  -- Join on consecutive days (yesterday vs today)\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    w2.temperature > w1.temperature;  -- Filter where today's temperature is higher than yesterday's temperature\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self Join**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `w1` represents the data for yesterday.\n",
    "   - `w2` represents the data for today.\n",
    "   - We join the `Weather` table with itself where the `recordDate` of `w2` is exactly one day after the `recordDate` of `w1`. This way, we compare the temperature of consecutive days.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temperature Comparison**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `WHERE` clause filters the results, ensuring that we only select rows where the temperature of today (`w2.temperature`) is greater than the temperature of yesterday (`w1.temperature`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the `id` of the Current Day**:\n",
    "   - We select `w2.id`, which corresponds to the current day (today), if the condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of rows in the `Weather` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The query involves a self join and a comparison for each pair of consecutive days. For each row, there is only one comparison, making it linear in the number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of rows in the `Weather` table.\n",
    "  - We store the results of the self join operation. The space complexity depends on the number of rows processed and the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Case Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL Schema and Data Insertion:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create the Weather table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Weather (\n",
    "    id INT,\n",
    "    recordDate DATE,\n",
    "    temperature INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert data into Weather table\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Weather;\n",
    "INSERT INTO Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) VALUES\n",
    "(1, '2015-01-01', 10),\n",
    "(2, '2015-01-02', 25),\n",
    "(3, '2015-01-03', 20),\n",
    "(4, '2015-01-04', 30);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Execute the Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Execute the query to find ids where today's temperature is higher than yesterday's\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    w2.id\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    Weather w1\n",
    "JOIN\n",
    "    Weather w2\n",
    "ON\n",
    "    w1.recordDate = w2.recordDate - INTERVAL '1 day'\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    w2.temperature > w1.temperature;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    " id\n",
    "----\n",
    "  2\n",
    "  4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **On 2015-01-02**, the temperature (25) is higher than the previous day (10), so the result includes `id = 2`.\n",
    "- **On 2015-01-04**, the temperature (30) is higher than the previous day (20), so the result includes `id = 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL query efficiently identifies the days with rising temperatures by leveraging a self join and a simple temperature comparison. It provides the `id` of the day when the temperature is higher than the previous day. The time and space complexity are optimal for this type of problem, with linear complexity in both time and space.\n"
