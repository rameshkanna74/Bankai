    "To make the provided code more efficient and safe, several improvements can be applied. These focus on error handling, connection management, query execution, and performance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use `contextlib` for connection management:** This ensures connections are automatically closed after use, even if an error occurs.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connection Management:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `get_connection` function is a context manager (`@contextmanager`) that handles PostgreSQL database connection setup and cleanup. This ensures that each connection is closed after its usage, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Column Name Fetching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `fetch_column_names_for_query`: This function executes the provided query with `LIMIT 0` to extract the column names dynamically based on the actual query. This is ideal for more complex queries (like joins) where table name-based fetching isn't sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fetching Data in Chunks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `fetch_data_in_chunks`: This function retrieves the data in chunks from the database to handle large datasets efficiently, avoiding loading everything into memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Query Function (`run_query_with_dynamic_columns`):**\n",
    "   - This function connects to each database, dynamically fetches the column names based on the provided query, retrieves the data in chunks, and combines the results into a single pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "   - It also adds a `database` column to each DataFrame to identify which database the data came from, which can be useful when querying multiple databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute the function by specifying the `db_configs` (database connection configurations) and the `user_query` (the SQL query to execute). The results will be returned as a pandas DataFrame, which you can then manipulate or analyze as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version is flexible, robust, and can handle complex queries across multiple databases efficiently.\n"
