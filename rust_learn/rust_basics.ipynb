    "Great! Let's dive into Rust's syntax, covering variables, functions, control flow, and data types. After that, we'll tackle Rust's unique concepts of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Rust Syntax: Variables, Functions, Control Flow, and Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Immutable variable\n",
    "    let x = 5; // 'let' declares a variable, 'x' is immutable by default\n",
    "    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Mutable variable\n",
    "    let mut y = 10; // 'mut' keyword makes 'y' mutable, allowing us to change its value\n",
    "    println!(\"The value of y is: {}\", y);\n",
    "\n",
    "    y = 20; // Now we can change the value of 'y' because it's mutable\n",

    "\n",
    "    // Constant variable\n",
    "    const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000; // 'const' declares a constant, which must have a type and is always immutable\n",
    "    println!(\"The maximum points are: {}\", MAX_POINTS);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables are immutable by default.\n",
    "- Use `mut` to make a variable mutable.\n",
    "- Constants are always immutable and must be type-annotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let num = 5;\n",
    "    let doubled = double(num); // Calling the function\n",
    "    println!(\"The double of {} is {}\", num, doubled);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Calling a function that returns nothing (unit type)\n",

    "    println!(\"Hello, {}!\", name);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions are defined with the `fn` keyword.\n",
    "- The return type is specified after the `->`.\n",
    "- The absence of a semicolon at the end of an expression indicates it's the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Control Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let number = 7;\n",
    "\n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Using if in a let statement\n",
    "    let is_even = if number % 2 == 0 { true } else { false };\n",
    "    println!(\"Is the number even? {}\", is_even);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Loop (infinite loop)\n",
    "    let mut counter = 0;\n",
    "    loop {\n",

    "    println!(\"Liftoff!\");\n",
    "\n",

    "        println!(\"i is: {}\", i);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust’s control flow includes `if`, `else if`, `else`, `loop`, `while`, and `for`.\n",
    "- `if` can return values directly, making it very flexible.\n",
    "- Loops can be broken with `break` and continued with `continue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Scalar types\n",
    "    let an_integer: i32 = 10; // 32-bit signed integer\n",
    "    let a_float: f64 = 3.14; // 64-bit floating-point number\n",
    "    let a_boolean: bool = true; // Boolean\n",
    "    let a_character: char = 'A'; // Character type, single quotes for char\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"Integer: {}, Float: {}, Boolean: {}, Character: {}\",\n",
    "             an_integer, a_float, a_boolean, a_character);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Compound types\n",
    "    let a_tuple: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1); // Tuple\n",
    "    let (x, y, z) = a_tuple; // Destructuring a tuple\n",
    "    println!(\"Tuple: x = {}, y = {}, z = {}\", x, y, z);\n",
    "\n",
    "    let an_array: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Array\n",
    "    println!(\"Array: {:?}\", an_array); // Use '{:?}' to print debug output for arrays and tuples\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust has scalar types (`i32`, `f64`, `bool`, `char`) and compound types (`tuples`, `arrays`).\n",
    "- Arrays have a fixed length, and tuples can have elements of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Understanding Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Ownership**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\"); // 's1' owns the string data\n",
    "    let s2 = s1; // 's1' moves ownership to 's2', 's1' is no longer valid\n",
    "    // println!(\"{}\", s1); // This line would cause a compile-time error\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"{}\", s2); // 's2' now owns the data\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Rust, every value has a single owner at a time.\n",
    "- When you assign or pass a value, ownership is moved (or \"transferred\") unless explicitly borrowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Borrowing**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n",
    "    let len = calculate_length(&s1); // '&s1' borrows 's1' without transferring ownership\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"The length of '{}' is {}.\", s1, len); // 's1' is still valid here\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {\n",
    "    s.len() // Using the borrowed reference\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Borrowing uses references (`&`), allowing you to use data without taking ownership.\n",
    "- Mutable references (`&mut`) allow changing the borrowed data, but only one mutable reference is allowed at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lifetimes**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let r; // 'r' does not have an initial value\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        let x = 5;\n",
    "        r = &x; // 'r' borrows 'x', but 'x' does not live long enough\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // println!(\"r: {}\", r); // This line would cause a compile-time error\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Correct use with lifetimes\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let x = 5;\n",
    "    let r = &x; // 'r' borrows 'x', and both are valid in this scope\n",
    "    println!(\"r: {}\", r);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lifetimes ensure that references are valid for as long as they are used.\n",
    "- The Rust compiler uses lifetimes to check that data does not outlive its reference, preventing dangling references.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By working through these examples and understanding the comments, you'll get a strong grasp of Rust's syntax, control flow, data types, and its unique ownership system. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any topic, feel free to ask!\n"

    "\n",
    "### **Floating-Point Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`f32`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: 32-bit floating-point number\n",
    "- **Range**: Approximately `±3.4 × 10^38` with 6-9 decimal digits of precision\n",

    "- **Example**: `let large_float: f64 = 3.141592653589793;`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integer Literals**: You can write integer literals with underscores for readability, e.g., `1_000_000`. Rust infers the type based on the value and context, but you can also explicitly specify types using suffixes (e.g., `10i32`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Floating-Point Literals**: Floating-point literals can use scientific notation (e.g., `1.0e3` for `1000.0`), and you can specify the type with suffixes (e.g., `3.14f64`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type Conversion**: Rust requires explicit type conversion. You can use the `as` keyword to cast between types. For example: `let x = 10 as f32;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Integer types\n",
    "    println!(\"The value of i8 MIN is: {}\", i8::MIN); // -128\n",

    "\n",
    "    println!(\"The value of u8 MIN is: {}\", u8::MIN); // 0\n",
    "    println!(\"The value of u8 MAX is: {}\", u8::MAX); // 255\n",

    "Certainly! Let's dive into Rust's `char` and `String` types, which are essential for handling text in Rust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`char` Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `char` type in Rust represents a single character.\n",
    "- It’s a 4-byte (32-bit) Unicode scalar value, which means it can represent more than just ASCII characters; it can hold any Unicode character, including characters from languages worldwide, emojis, and symbols.\n",
    "- A `char` is denoted with single quotes (e.g., `'a'`, `'A'`, `'😊'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Basic characters\n",
    "    let letter: char = 'A';\n",
    "    let emoji: char = '😊';\n",
    "    let chinese_character: char = '你'; // Chinese character for \"you\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"The letter is: {}\", letter);\n",
    "    println!(\"The emoji is: {}\", emoji);\n",
    "    println!(\"The Chinese character is: {}\", chinese_character);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Using a character as a Unicode escape sequence\n",
    "    let heart = '\\u{2764}'; // Unicode code point for a heart (❤)\n",
    "    println!(\"The heart symbol is: {}\", heart);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `char` is a 4-byte Unicode scalar value, meaning it can represent any valid Unicode character.\n",
    "- You can use Unicode escape sequences like `\\u{2764}` to represent characters using their Unicode code point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`String` Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `String` type in Rust is a growable, mutable, owned collection of `char` values.\n",
    "- Strings in Rust are UTF-8 encoded, allowing them to store text from any language.\n",
    "- `String` is different from string slices (`&str`), which are views into a `String` and are not owned by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Creating Strings**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Creating a new empty String\n",
    "    let mut s = String::new();\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Appending to a String\n",
    "    s.push('H'); // Adding a single character\n",
    "    s.push_str(\"ello, World!\"); // Adding a string slice\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"{}\", s); // Prints \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Creating a String from a string literal\n",
    "    let s1 = String::from(\"Hello, Rust!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Concatenating Strings\n",
    "    let s2 = s + \" \" + &s1; // Using + operator\n",
    "    println!(\"{}\", s2); // Prints \"Hello, World! Hello, Rust!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Using format! macro for concatenation\n",
    "    let s3 = format!(\"{} - {}\", s2, \"Let's code!\");\n",
    "    println!(\"{}\", s3); // Prints \"Hello, World! Hello, Rust! - Let's code!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `String::new()` creates an empty `String`.\n",
    "- You can append to a `String` using `push` (for a single `char`) and `push_str` (for a `&str`).\n",
    "- Concatenation can be done using the `+` operator or the `format!` macro, which is more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **String Slices (`&str`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `&str` is an immutable reference to a sequence of characters in a `String`.\n",
    "- String slices are often used for passing strings around without transferring ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let s = String::from(\"Hello, Rust!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    // String slice\n",
    "    let slice = &s[0..5]; // Slice of the first 5 characters\n",
    "    println!(\"Slice: {}\", slice); // Prints \"Hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Function that takes a &str\n",
    "    print_slice(slice);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn print_slice(s: &str) {\n",
    "    println!(\"String slice: {}\", s);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `&str` is used to borrow a part or all of a `String` without taking ownership.\n",
    "- Slices can be created using range indices, like `[0..5]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **String Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Length**: `String` can calculate its length using `len()` (in bytes, not characters).\n",
    "- **Iteration**: You can iterate over a `String` by characters, bytes, or lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let s = String::from(\"Hello, Rust!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Length of the String (in bytes)\n",
    "    println!(\"Length: {}\", s.len()); // 12 bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Iterating over characters\n",
    "    for c in s.chars() {\n",
    "        println!(\"Character: {}\", c);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Iterating over bytes\n",
    "    for b in s.bytes() {\n",
    "        println!(\"Byte: {}\", b);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `len()` returns the number of bytes in the `String`.\n",
    "- Use `chars()` to iterate over characters and `bytes()` to iterate over raw bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`char`**: Represents a single Unicode character and is 4 bytes in size. Useful for working with individual characters, including symbols and emojis.\n",
    "- **`String`**: A growable, mutable, owned UTF-8 encoded string. It’s used when you need ownership and mutability.\n",
    "- **`&str`**: A slice of a `String`, representing a view into a `String` without owning it. It's often used for function parameters to allow borrowing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples should help clarify how to work with text in Rust. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n"

    "\n",
    "### **Understanding Arrays in Rust**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Array Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Declaration**: An array is declared using square brackets `[]`, with the type of elements and the number of elements specified. The syntax is `[T; N]`, where `T` is the type of elements, and `N` is the number of elements in the array.\n",

    "Understanding **Ownership**, **Borrowing**, and **Lifetimes** is crucial to mastering Rust. These concepts are key to Rust's memory safety guarantees, allowing the language to prevent common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and data races.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Ownership**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**\n",
    "- Every value in Rust has a single owner. When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the memory associated with that value. \n",
    "- Ownership is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Rules of Ownership**\n",
    "1. Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.\n",
    "2. There can only be one owner at a time.\n",
    "3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Ownership Example:**\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\"); // s1 owns the String\n",

    "    println!(\"{}\", s2); // Prints: hello\n",
    "} // s2 goes out of scope, and the memory is deallocated\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Transfer of Ownership:**\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n",
    "    let s2 = s1; // s1 is no longer valid after this point\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**\n",
    "- Borrowing allows you to use a value without taking ownership of it. \n",
    "- Instead of moving ownership, you can create references (`&T` for immutable and `&mut T` for mutable) to a value, letting other parts of your code use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Immutable Borrowing**\n",
    "- You can have multiple immutable references to a value.\n",
    "- However, you cannot have an immutable reference if there’s an active mutable reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let s = String::from(\"hello\");\n",
    "    \n",
    "    let len = calculate_length(&s); // Passing a reference\n",

    "} // s goes out of scope, but nothing happens because we don’t have ownership\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Mutable Borrowing**\n",
    "- You can have only one mutable reference to a value at a time.\n",
    "- This prevents data races at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "### **3. Lifetimes**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**\n",
    "- Lifetimes are a way of ensuring that references are valid as long as you need them to be, but no longer. \n",
    "- Rust's borrow checker uses lifetimes to ensure that references do not outlive the data they point to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Lifetime Annotation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lifetimes are annotated using a syntax like `<'a>`, and they are usually required when a function returns a reference, especially when the function takes references as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example without Explicit Lifetimes (Relies on Lifetime Elision):**\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",

    "        y\n",

    "\n",
    "fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {\n",
    "    if x.len() > y.len() {\n",
    "        x\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        y\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Common Lifetime Annotations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`'static` Lifetime**: Indicates that the reference can live for the entire duration of the program. For example, string literals have a `'static` lifetime because they are stored in the program’s binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let s: &'static str = \"hello\"; // s has a 'static lifetime\n",
    "    println!(\"{}\", s);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lifetime Elision Rules**\n",
    "Rust has certain rules that it applies to infer lifetimes where they aren't explicitly stated. These rules often save you from having to write lifetimes in simple cases, like in the `longest` function above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "- **Ownership**: Controls the lifetime of data. When a value goes out of scope, its memory is deallocated.\n",
    "- **Borrowing**: Allows references to data without transferring ownership. There are immutable (`&T`) and mutable (`&mut T`) references.\n",
    "- **Lifetimes**: Ensure references are valid as long as necessary, preventing dangling references.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### **Returning Values from Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can return values using the `->` syntax, followed by the return type. The last expression in the function body is the return value (no `return` keyword is needed unless you want an early return).\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let sum = add(5, 10);\n",
    "    println!(\"Sum is: {}\", sum); // Prints: Sum is: 15\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {\n",
    "    x + y // No semicolon means this is the return value\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to return early, you can use the `return` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let result = maybe_add(5, 0);\n",
    "    println!(\"Result is: {}\", result); // Prints: Result is: 5\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn maybe_add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {\n",
    "    if y == 0 {\n",
    "        return x; // Early return\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    x + y\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Function Pointers**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass functions as arguments to other functions using function pointers. This is useful for higher-order functions, where the behavior of the function depends on another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let result = apply(5, 10, add);\n",
    "    println!(\"Result is: {}\", result); // Prints: Result is: 15\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn apply(x: i32, y: i32, f: fn(i32, i32) -> i32) -> i32 {\n",
    "    f(x, y) // Calls the function passed as an argument\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {\n",
    "    x + y\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Closures**\n",
    "\n",
    "Closures in Rust are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions. They are similar to functions but have more flexibility, particularly in capturing variables from the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Basic Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "A closure is defined using `||` to capture parameters, followed by the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let add = |x, y| x + y; // A closure that adds two numbers\n",
    "    println!(\"Sum is: {}\", add(5, 10)); // Prints: Sum is: 15\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Capturing Environment Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Closures can capture variables from their environment, meaning they can access variables that are in scope at the time the closure is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let x = 10;\n",
    "    let add_to_x = |y| x + y; // Captures the value of `x` from the environment\n",
    "    println!(\"Result is: {}\", add_to_x(5)); // Prints: Result is: 15\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Mutable Closures**\n",
    "\n",
    "Closures can also mutate the variables they capture, but to do so, the closure itself must be mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let mut x = 10;\n",
    "    let mut change_x = || {\n",
    "        x += 5; // Mutating the captured variable\n",
    "        println!(\"Inside closure: {}\", x);\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    change_x(); // Prints: Inside closure: 15\n",
    "    println!(\"Outside closure: {}\", x); // Prints: Outside closure: 15\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Returning Closures**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also return closures from functions, but you need to use a `Box` or other smart pointer since closures can be of unknown size.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let add_five = make_adder(5);\n",
    "    println!(\"Result: {}\", add_five(10)); // Prints: Result: 15\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn make_adder(x: i32) -> Box<dyn Fn(i32) -> i32> {\n",
    "    Box::new(move |y| x + y) // `move` keyword moves `x` into the closure\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use Closures**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Callbacks**: When you need to pass logic into functions, such as with iterators, filters, or mapping operations.\n",
    "- **Inline Operations**: For concise code where defining a full function would be overkill.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with Iterators:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n",
    "    let doubled: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();\n",
    "    println!(\"{:?}\", doubled); // Prints: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions**: Understand how to define, return values from, and pass functions as pointers.\n",
    "- **Closures**: Master how to create closures, capture environment variables, and use them in higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering functions and closures will prepare you to tackle complex coding problems on LeetCode, especially those involving callbacks, inline transformations, or custom operations."

    "### **4. Enums and Pattern Matching in Rust**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enums** and **Pattern Matching** are powerful features in Rust that allow you to define types that can be in one of several states and then handle those states elegantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Enums**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enums (short for \"enumerations\") allow you to define a type that can be one of several variants. Each variant can have associated data, making enums extremely versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Basic Enum Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "enum Direction {\n",
    "    North,\n",
    "    South,\n",
    "    East,\n",
    "    West,\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let dir = Direction::North;\n",
    "    print_direction(dir);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn print_direction(direction: Direction) {\n",
    "    match direction {\n",
    "        Direction::North => println!(\"Heading North!\"),\n",
    "        Direction::South => println!(\"Heading South!\"),\n",
    "        Direction::East => println!(\"Heading East!\"),\n",
    "        Direction::West => println!(\"Heading West!\"),\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Direction` is an enum with four possible variants: `North`, `South`, `East`, and `West`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Enums with Associated Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enums can also hold data, which can differ by variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "enum Message {\n",
    "    Quit,\n",
    "    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\n",
    "    Write(String),\n",
    "    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let msg = Message::Move { x: 10, y: 20 };\n",
    "    process_message(msg);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn process_message(msg: Message) {\n",
    "    match msg {\n",
    "        Message::Quit => println!(\"Quit the game\"),\n",
    "        Message::Move { x, y } => println!(\"Move to coordinates ({}, {})\", x, y),\n",
    "        Message::Write(text) => println!(\"Text message: {}\", text),\n",
    "        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!(\"Change color to RGB({}, {}, {})\", r, g, b),\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `Message` enum can hold different types of data depending on the variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Enums in Action: The `Option` Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common enums in Rust is `Option`, which represents a value that might be present (`Some`) or absent (`None`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let some_number = Some(5);\n",
    "    let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;\n",
    "\n",
    "    match some_number {\n",
    "        Some(value) => println!(\"We have a value: {}\", value),\n",
    "        None => println!(\"No value\"),\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    match absent_number {\n",
    "        Some(value) => println!(\"We have a value: {}\", value),\n",
    "        None => println!(\"No value\"),\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `Option` type is extremely useful for functions that might not always return a value, allowing you to avoid null references.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Pattern Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern matching allows you to concisely handle different possibilities in your code. The most common way to use pattern matching in Rust is with the `match` keyword, which works with enums, `Option`, `Result`, and other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Basic `match` Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `match` statement checks a value against a series of patterns and executes the code associated with the first matching pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let number = 7;\n",
    "\n",
    "    match number {\n",
    "        1 => println!(\"One!\"),\n",
    "        2 => println!(\"Two!\"),\n",
    "        3 => println!(\"Three!\"),\n",
    "        4 | 5 | 6 => println!(\"Four, Five, or Six!\"),\n",
    "        _ => println!(\"Not in the range 1-6\"), // The _ pattern is a catch-all\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `number` is matched against several possible values, with `4 | 5 | 6` being an example of a match for multiple values, and `_` being a wildcard that matches anything not explicitly handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Pattern Matching with Enums**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern matching is especially powerful with enums, where it allows you to destructure and work with the associated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(255, 0, 0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    match msg {\n",
    "        Message::Quit => println!(\"Quit the game\"),\n",
    "        Message::Move { x, y } => println!(\"Move to coordinates ({}, {})\", x, y),\n",
    "        Message::Write(text) => println!(\"Text message: {}\", text),\n",
    "        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!(\"Change color to RGB({}, {}, {})\", r, g, b),\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we see how you can destructure the `Message::Move` and `Message::ChangeColor` variants to access their data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The `if let` and `while let` Constructs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you only care about one specific pattern and want to ignore others. The `if let` construct allows for concise syntax when you only care about a single variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let some_value = Some(10);\n",
    "\n",
    "    if let Some(x) = some_value {\n",
    "        println!(\"Matched: {}\", x);\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        println!(\"No match\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to a `match` that only cares about the `Some` variant. The `if let` construct is useful when you want to do something with the matched value and don't need to handle other cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`while let`** can be used in loops where you want to continue processing as long as a certain pattern matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let mut stack = Vec::new();\n",
    "\n",
    "    stack.push(1);\n",
    "    stack.push(2);\n",
    "    stack.push(3);\n",
    "\n",
    "    while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {\n",
    "        println!(\"Popped: {}\", top);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `while let` keeps popping and printing elements from the stack until it’s empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enums**: Enums allow you to define a type with multiple variants, optionally with associated data. They are crucial for modeling data with multiple states.\n",
    "- **Pattern Matching**: Pattern matching with `match` is a powerful way to handle different possibilities in your code, especially when working with enums. The `if let` and `while let` constructs provide a more concise syntax for simple cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering enums and pattern matching will allow you to handle complex data types and scenarios elegantly in Rust, which is essential for tackling LeetCode problems and other real-world challenges."

    "\n",
    "Rust provides robust error handling mechanisms primarily through the `Result` and `Option` types. These types allow you to handle scenarios where operations may fail or where values may be absent, both of which are common in LeetCode problems and real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The `Result` type is used for functions that can return either a success or an error. It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "enum Result<T, E> {\n",

    "    } else {\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    match divide(10.0, 2.0) {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide` function returns a `Result` indicating whether the division was successful or if there was an error (like division by zero).\n",

    "#### **B. The `Option` Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Option` type is used when a value might be present or absent. It is defined as:\n",

    "##### **Basic Example of `Option`**\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Key Methods for `Result` and `Option`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust provides several methods to work with `Result` and `Option` types, making error handling more ergonomic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. `unwrap` and `expect`**\n",
    "\n",

    "  // Panics because it tries to unwrap a None\n",
    "  let none_value: Option<i32> = None;\n",
    "  // none_value.unwrap(); // Would panic\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`expect`**: Similar to `unwrap`, but allows you to provide a custom panic message.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```rust\n",
    "  let result = divide(10.0, 0.0).expect(\"Failed to divide\"); // Panics with custom message\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. `is_some` and `is_none`**\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are used to check if an `Option` contains a value or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`is_some`**: Returns `true` if the `Option` is `Some`.\n",

    "\n",
    "These methods allow you to transform `Result` or `Option` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`map`**: Applies a function to the contained value (if any) and returns a new `Option` or `Result`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```rust\n",
    "  let number = Some(4);\n",
    "  let doubled = number.map(|x| x * 2);\n",

    "### **Traits and `impl` in Rust: A Comparison with Python Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust, unlike Python, is not an object-oriented language in the traditional sense. However, it provides powerful abstractions through **traits** and **impl blocks**, which can serve similar purposes to Python's classes and methods in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Traits in Rust**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces or abstract base classes in other languages. They define a set of methods that a type must implement but do not provide the implementation themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Defining a Trait**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "trait Area {\n",
    "    fn area(&self) -> f64;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Area` trait defines a method `area` that any type implementing this trait must provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Implementing a Trait for a Struct**\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a trait for a struct (similar to how you would define methods for a class in Python), you use the `impl` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "struct Circle {\n",
    "    radius: f64,\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "impl Area for Circle {\n",
    "    fn area(&self) -> f64 {\n",
    "        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "struct Rectangle {\n",
    "    width: f64,\n",
    "    height: f64,\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "impl Area for Rectangle {\n",
    "    fn area(&self) -> f64 {\n",
    "        self.width * self.height\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let circle = Circle { radius: 5.0 };\n",
    "    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 3.0, height: 4.0 };\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"Circle area: {}\", circle.area());\n",
    "    println!(\"Rectangle area: {}\", rectangle.area());\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Circle` and `Rectangle` structs both implement the `Area` trait.\n",
    "- The `area` method is specific to each struct, but the caller can use the same method name regardless of the type.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Traits vs. Python Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Classes**: In Python, you define a class with attributes (data) and methods (functions) together. Methods are typically defined within the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Circle:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "          self.radius = radius\n",
    "      \n",
    "      def area(self):\n",
    "          return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "  class Rectangle:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "          self.width = width\n",
    "          self.height = height\n",
    "      \n",
    "      def area(self):\n",
    "          return self.width * self.height\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rust Traits**: In Rust, traits define a set of methods that types can implement, but the data (attributes) and methods (functions) are separate. Rust’s approach is more focused on behavior (what a type can do) rather than combining data and behavior in a single entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. The `impl` Block in Rust**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `impl` block is used to implement methods for a specific type, similar to defining methods within a Python class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Implementing Methods on Structs**\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "struct Circle {\n",
    "    radius: f64,\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "impl Circle {\n",
    "    fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {\n",
    "        Self { radius }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    fn diameter(&self) -> f64 {\n",
    "        self.radius * 2.0\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let circle = Circle::new(5.0);\n",
    "    println!(\"Circle diameter: {}\", circle.diameter());\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `impl Circle` block defines methods specific to the `Circle` struct.\n",
    "- The `new` method is a constructor, similar to Python’s `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Difference from Python Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Encapsulation**: In Python, the data (attributes) and methods are encapsulated within the class itself. In Rust, data (in structs) and behavior (in impl blocks) are separated, promoting clear distinctions between data and methods.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Multiple `impl` Blocks**: Rust allows you to define multiple `impl` blocks for a single struct, which can be useful for organizing related methods or implementing multiple traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```rust\n",
    "  impl Circle {\n",
    "      fn circumference(&self) -> f64 {\n",
    "          2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Inheritance**: Rust does not have inheritance like Python classes. Instead, Rust uses traits to share behavior across types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Traits and `impl` for Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Rust, polymorphism is achieved through traits. You can write functions that accept trait objects, allowing for flexible and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn print_area<T: Area>(shape: T) {\n",
    "    println!(\"Area: {}\", shape.area());\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let circle = Circle { radius: 5.0 };\n",
    "    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 3.0, height: 4.0 };\n",
    "\n",
    "    print_area(circle);\n",
    "    print_area(rectangle);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `print_area` can accept any type that implements the `Area` trait, demonstrating Rust's approach to polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Polymorphism in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, polymorphism is often achieved through inheritance or by defining methods with the same name across different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_area(shape):\n",
    "    print(f\"Area: {shape.area()}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "circle = Circle(5)\n",
    "rectangle = Rectangle(3, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_area(circle)\n",
    "print_area(rectangle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traits in Rust**: Define shared behavior across different types without the need for inheritance.\n",
    "- **`impl` Blocks in Rust**: Used to define methods for a specific type, similar to methods in Python classes.\n",
    "- **Python Classes**: Combine data and behavior, often using inheritance for shared behavior. Rust separates these concerns, focusing on behavior through traits and implementing methods via `impl`.\n",
