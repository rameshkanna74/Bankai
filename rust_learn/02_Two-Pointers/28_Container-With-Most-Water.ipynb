    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Two Pointers Approach**: We start with two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and the other at the end (`right`) of the `height` array.\n",
    "2. **Area Calculation**: The area is calculated as `width * min(height[left], height[right])`, where `width` is the distance between the two pointers.\n",
    "3. **Update Maximum Area**: We keep track of the maximum area found during the iterations.\n",
    "4. **Move Pointers**: To potentially find a larger area, we move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward, hoping to find a taller line that could increase the area.\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: This process continues until the `left` pointer meets the `right` pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\) - We only traverse the array once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) - No extra space is used other than a few variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently finds the maximum area with minimal computational overhead.\n"
