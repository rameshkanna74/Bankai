    "To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters, an efficient approach is to use the **sliding window technique** with a **hash set**. This approach ensures that we maintain a substring with unique characters while expanding and contracting the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sliding Window**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the current window of characters.\n",
    "   - Expand the `end` pointer to include more characters in the window.\n",
    "   - If a duplicate character is found, move the `start` pointer to reduce the window size until the duplicate is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hash Set**:\n",
    "   - Use a hash set to keep track of characters in the current window and quickly check for duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm runs in \\(O(n)\\) time complexity, where \\(n\\) is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once by the `end` pointer and once by the `start` pointer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is \\(O(min(n, m))\\), where \\(m\\) is the size of the character set. In practice, this is constant space for a fixed-size character set (like ASCII).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the Rust implementation with clear comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn length_of_longest_substring(s: String) -> i32 {\n",
    "        // Convert the input string to a vector of characters\n",

    "\n",
    "        let mut max_length = 0; // To store the maximum length of substring found\n",
    "        let mut start = 0; // Start index of the sliding window\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Iterate over each character with the end pointer\n",
    "        for end in 0..chars.len() {\n",
    "            // If the character is already in the set, remove characters from the start\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Character Conversion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Convert the input string to a vector of characters to facilitate easier character manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hash Set**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use a hash set `char_set` to keep track of the unique characters in the current window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sliding Window Logic**:\n",

    "   - Expand the `end` pointer to include more characters in the window.\n",
    "   - If a duplicate is detected (i.e., the character is already in the hash set), move the `start` pointer to shrink the window until the duplicate is removed.\n",
    "   - Update `max_length` with the maximum length of the current window.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example Cases**:\n",
    "   - The `main` function includes test cases to validate the implementation.\n",

    "The sliding window approach I provided is already quite efficient with a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\) and a space complexity of \\(O(m)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the string and \\(m\\) is the size of the character set. Given that the character set size is fixed (e.g., ASCII), the space complexity is essentially constant in practical terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few refinements and alternative methods you might consider. One such refinement involves using an array for character indexing instead of a hash set. This can be slightly more efficient since array lookups are faster than hash set operations.\n",

    "If you are working with a fixed character set like ASCII (which is a common scenario), you can use an array to keep track of the last seen index of each character.
