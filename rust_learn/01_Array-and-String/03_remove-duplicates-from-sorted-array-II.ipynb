    "def remove_duplicates(nums):\n",
    "    # If the array has 2 or fewer elements, return its length as no duplicates need to be removed\n",
    "    if len(nums) <= 2:\n",

    "    # Start iterating from the third element (index 2)\n",
    "    for current_position in range(2, len(nums)):\n",
    "        # Compare the current element with the element two positions back\n",
    "        if nums[current_position] != nums[next_position - 2]:\n",
    "            nums[next_position] = nums[current_position]\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. The array is traversed once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The operation is done in place without using any additional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "1. **Initial Check**: If the array has 2 or fewer elements, no duplicates need to be removed, so the function returns the length of the array as it is.\n",
    "2. **Pointer `next_position`**: This pointer starts at index 2, where the next allowed element will be placed.\n",
    "3. **Iterating the Array**: \n",
    "   - The loop starts from the third element (index 2) and checks if the current element is the same as the element two positions back (`nums[next_position - 2]`).\n",
    "   - If it's different, it means the element is allowed (appearing at most twice), and it's moved to the `next_position`. The pointer `next_position` is then incremented.\n",
    "4. **Final Result**: After the loop, `next_position` represents the number of elements in the array after removing the extra duplicates. The first `next_position` elements in `nums` contain the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the duplicates are removed in place with the optimal time and space complexity."
