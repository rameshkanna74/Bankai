    "To solve the problem of maximizing profit by buying and selling stock on different days, we can use a single pass through the array to keep track of the minimum price encountered so far and calculate the maximum profit at each step.\n",

    "### Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def max_profit(prices):\n",
    "    # Initialize minimum price to a large value and max profit to zero\n",
    "    min_price = float('inf')\n",
    "    max_profit = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Iterate through each price in the list\n",
    "    for price in prices:\n",
    "        # Update min_price if the current price is lower\n",
    "        if price < min_price:\n",
    "            min_price = price\n",
    "        # Calculate profit if we sold at the current price, update max_profit if this profit is higher\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `prices` array. We only make a single pass through the array.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "1. **Initialize**:\n",
    "   - `min_price` is set to a very large value (`float('inf')`) initially, representing the lowest price found so far.\n",
    "   - `max_profit` is initialized to zero, as no profit has been made yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate through Prices**:\n",
    "   - For each `price` in the array, update `min_price` if the current `price` is lower than the previous `min_price`.\n",
    "   - Calculate the potential profit if the stock was bought at `min_price` and sold at the current `price`. If this profit is greater than the `max_profit` found so far, update `max_profit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the Result**:\n",
    "   - After the loop finishes, `max_profit` will contain the maximum possible profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution efficiently finds the maximum profit with the best possible time and space complexity."
