This allows us to easily compare the citation counts with their corresponding indices.\n","2. **Finding the h-index**: We iterate through the sorted list to find the highest index `i` where the number of citations at that index is greater than or equal to `i + 1`. This is the definition of the h-index.\n","3. **Stopping condition**: If a paper has fewer citations than its index (plus one), we stop and return the h-index found so far.\n","\n","### Time and Space Complexity:\n","\n","- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) – The most time-consuming operation is sorting the citations, which is O(n log n). The subsequent iteration is O(n).\n","- **Space Complexity**: O(1) – We are sorting the array in place and using a constant amount of extra space.\n","\n","This code effectively calculates the h-index of a researcher based on their citation counts, following the optimal time and space complexity given the constraints.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"moon","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
