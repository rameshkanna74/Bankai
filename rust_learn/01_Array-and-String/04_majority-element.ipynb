    "To solve the problem in linear time with O(1) space complexity, we can use the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**. This algorithm is efficient and works in a single pass through the array while using only a constant amount of extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def majority_element(nums):\n",
    "    # Initialize candidate for majority element and its count\n",
    "    candidate = None\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm\n",
    "    for num in nums:\n",
    "        if count == 0:\n",
    "            candidate = num  # Set the current element as the candidate\n",
    "        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)  # Increment or decrement count based on match\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # The candidate now holds the majority element\n",
    "    return candidate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. We pass through the array just once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The algorithm only uses a few variables (`candidate` and `count`), making it very space efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "1. **Candidate Initialization**: \n",
    "   - We start with `candidate` as `None` and `count` as 0.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Iterating Through the Array**:\n",
    "   - If `count` is 0, it means there is no current candidate, so we set the current element as the `candidate`.\n",
    "   - If the current element is the same as the `candidate`, we increment the `count`.\n",
    "   - If it's different, we decrement the `count`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Majority Element**:\n",
    "   - The idea behind the algorithm is that the majority element will eventually remain as the candidate after we cancel out all other elements.\n",
    "   - At the end of the loop, the `candidate` will be the majority element, as it has the highest count.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is optimal for finding the majority element with the best possible time and space complexity."
