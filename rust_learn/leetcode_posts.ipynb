    "# My Google L5 Interview Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello LeetCode Community,\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, my journey for the Google L5 process has come to an end. After 3 months of rigorous preparation, I received a rejection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few months, I solved more than 250 questions (focusing on medium and hard problems) and covered major concepts such as Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Disjoint Sets, and other advanced data structures. I truly gave it my all.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also participated in three mock interviews with Google employees before my onsite interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mock Interviews\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mock Interview 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** Given a list of words and a target word, find if the word exists in the dictionary.  \n",
    "  **Follow-up:** Given a matrix of characters, find all the words that exist in the dictionary, without reusing the same cell for each word.  \n",
    "  **Solution:** Solved using a Trie.  \n",
    "  **Feedback:** Strong hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mock Interview 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** There are n trains coming to a station, each with a unique ID and a different arrival time. Given a train ID and time, find the closest train that will arrive.  \n",
    "  **Solution:** Solved using HashMap and TreeMap.  \n",
    "  **Feedback:** Strong hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mock Interview 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** Stock prices are given for each day in an array. You can make any number of transactions, but at any time you can either buy or sell (no consecutive buys or sells).  \n",
    "  **Solution:** Solved using Dynamic Programming.  \n",
    "  **Feedback:** Strong hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these successful mock interviews, I felt confident and ready for the onsite interviews.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Question:** There are n friends living in different cities across a graph. Find the shortest distance between two friends (e.g., A and B).  \n",
    "  **Solution:** Solved using BFS (Dijkstra's algorithm).  \n",
    "  **Follow-up:** Given k friends, find the node where the total distance for all friends to reach is minimized.  \n",
    "  **Solution:** Solved by applying BFS from each friend and checking nodes that all k friends visit.  \n",
    "  **Feedback:** Strong hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round 2 (The Downhill Part):**\n",
    "The interviewer came late (by 5 minutes), didn’t ask for an introduction, and provided a vague problem. It took some time to fully understand the question. The hints were not helpful and actually made things worse. In the end, I was asked to write down whatever I thought would work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** You are given a matrix of 0s, 1s, and 2s, where 0 means an empty cell, 1 means a wall, and 2 means an exit. Generate a sequence of instructions (U, D, L, R) such that no matter where you start in the matrix, you always reach the exit.  \n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  1 0 1\n",
    "  0 2 0\n",
    "  1 0 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  **Answer:** UDLR (No matter where you start, you’ll end up at 2).  \n",
    "  **Feedback:** Not hire (feedback: weak in problem-solving).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** You are receiving signals from a robot at different timestamps (in non-decreasing order). There could be duplicate messages. Print only the messages that are unique in the last 10 seconds.  \n",
    "  **Follow-up:** Classify duplicate messages as bugs. Don’t print a message if it’s repeated within the 10 seconds window (future or past).  \n",
    "  **Input:** `[{timeStamp: 1, message: \"Hello\"}, {timeStamp: 2, message: \"Hello\"}, {timeStamp: 8, message: \"Hey\"}, {timeStamp: 12, message: \"Hello\"}]`  \n",
    "  **Output:** Hello Hey Hello  \n",
    "  **Follow-up Output:** Hey Hello (First \"Hello\" is excluded due to duplicates within a 10-second window).  \n",
    "  **Solution:** Solved both the main problem and the follow-up. I thought it went well, but the feedback was that my approach wasn’t optimized, and they were looking for more scalable solutions.  \n",
    "  **Feedback:** Lean not hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s where my journey ends. I hope these questions and my interview experience help the community. I’ve worked incredibly hard over the last 3 months without any breaks, and now I’m going to take some time to rest.\n",

    "Google focuses heavily on data structures and algorithms, leading to four rounds of DSA interviews. Only after passing these rounds is there a single round of system design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time management is crucial in Google interviews. You must discuss your solution with the interviewer, explain it, code it, and optimize it all within 15-20 minutes—no easy feat! This means solving medium-level LeetCode problems within 5-10 minutes on your own.\n",
    "\n",
