    "You are given a 2D integer array intervals where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] represents the inclusive interval [lefti, righti].\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to divide the intervals into one or more groups such that each interval is in exactly one group, and no two intervals that are in the same group intersect each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of groups you need to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two intervals intersect if there is at least one common number between them. For example, the intervals [1, 5] and [5, 8] intersect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: intervals = [[5,10],[6,8],[1,5],[2,3],[1,10]]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: We can divide the intervals into the following groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Group 1: [1, 5], [6, 8].\n",
    "- Group 2: [2, 3], [5, 10].\n",
    "- Group 3: [1, 10].\n",
    "  It can be proven that it is not possible to divide the intervals into fewer than 3 groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10],[11,13]]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: None of the intervals overlap, so we can put all of them in one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= intervals.length <= 105\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collecting Starts and Ends:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Two vectors, `starts` and `ends`, are populated with the starting and ending points of each interval. This separation helps to process the intervals independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sorting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Both vectors are sorted using `sort_unstable()`, which is efficient and sufficient for this use case since we only care about order and not about stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Two-Pointer Technique:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We use two indices, `start_idx` and `end_idx`, to traverse the sorted start and end times.\n",
    "   - The main logic compares the current start time with the current end time:\n",
    "     - If a new interval starts before the previous one ends, we increment the count of active intervals (`total`).\n",
    "     - If the current interval has ended, we decrement the count of active intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tracking Maximum Active Intervals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `max_total` keeps track of the maximum number of overlapping intervals at any point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result:**\n",
    "   - Finally, the function returns the maximum number of groups needed, which is stored in `max_total`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** \\(O(n \\log n)\\) due to the sorting steps, where \\(n\\) is the number of intervals.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** \\(O(n)\\) for storing the start and end vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient and effective for the problem at hand!\n"
