    "Your provided implementation of the `find_kth_bit` function in Rust is straightforward, but it constructs the entire string \\( S_n \\), which can be inefficient for larger \\( n \\). Instead, we can optimize the solution by using the properties of the recursive structure without needing to generate the full string. Below is a modified version of your function, with comments and optimizations:\n",

    "### Explanation of the Optimized Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Length Calculation**:\n",
    "   - The length of the string \\( S_n \\) is calculated as \\( 2^n - 1 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Function**:\n",
    "   - The `find_kth_bit_recursive` function determines where \\( k \\) lies:\n",
    "     - If \\( k \\) is exactly at the middle index, return '1'.\n",
    "     - If \\( k \\) is in the left half, recursively find the bit in \\( S_{n-1} \\).\n",
    "     - If \\( k \\) is in the right half, adjust \\( k \\) for the corresponding position in the inverted string and recurse again.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bit Inversion**:\n",
    "   - When accessing the right half, the bit is inverted by checking whether it's '0' or '1'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\), due to the depth of recursion.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\), due to the recursion stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is much more efficient than generating the entire string and works well for the constraints provided."
