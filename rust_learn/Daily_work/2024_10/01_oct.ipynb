    "   - For pairs of remainders that sum to `k`, we ensure that their counts are equal.\n",
    "   - If `i` is exactly half of `k` (which can only happen when `k` is even), we need an even number of that remainder.\n",
    "   - The remainder 0 must also have an even count since pairs must sum to something divisible by `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, we return `true`. If any check fails, we return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - we iterate through the array once to count remainders and then iterate through at most `k/2` for checking conditions.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(k) - we use an array of size `k` to store the counts of remainders.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - `can_arrange(arr: Vec<i32>, k: i32) -> bool`: The function takes a vector of integers and an integer `k` and returns a boolean indicating if the integers can be paired such that their sums are divisible by `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frequency Array**:\n",
    "   - `let mut remainder_count = vec![0; k as usize];`: This initializes a frequency array to count how many numbers yield each possible remainder when divided by `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remainder Calculation**:\n",
    "   - `let remainder = ((number % k + k) % k) as usize;`: This line computes the remainder of `number` when divided by `k`, ensuring it is non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check for Pairs**:\n",
    "   - The code checks if there are an even number of elements with a remainder of 0 since they need to be paired together.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Complementary Remainders**:\n",
    "   - For each remainder `i`, it checks that the count of numbers with remainder `i` matches the count of numbers with remainder `k - i`. This ensures pairs can be formed for all remainders.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Example Case**:\n",
    "   - In the `main` function, an example array is defined and passed to `can_arrange`. The result is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code maintains O(n) time complexity and O(k) space complexity, which is efficient given the problem constraints."
