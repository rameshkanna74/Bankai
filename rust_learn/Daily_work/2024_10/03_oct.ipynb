    "Given an array of positive integers nums, remove the smallest subarray (possibly empty) such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by p. It is not allowed to remove the whole array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or -1 if it's impossible.\n",

    "A subarray is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.\n",

    "Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Type Conversion**: We convert the input `nums` to `i64` to handle potential overflow during calculations, especially when summing large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Total Sum and Remainder Calculation**: We calculate the total sum of the array and find its remainder when divided by \\( p \\). If the total sum is already divisible by \\( p \\), we return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Minimum Length Initialization**: We start with `min_length` set to the length of the `nums` array, assuming we might need to remove a large subarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prefix Sum and Remainder Tracking**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We maintain a running `current_sum` as we iterate through `nums`.\n",
    "   - For each element, we compute the current remainder and check:\n",
    "     - If removing the prefix gives a sum divisible by \\( p \\).\n",
    "     - If the hash map has a previously stored remainder that allows us to achieve a divisible sum after removing a subarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hash Map Usage**: The hash map tracks the latest index of each prefix sum remainder, which helps quickly identify valid subarrays to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Check**: If `min_length` wasn't updated (still equals the length of the array), we return -1, indicating no valid subarray was found. Otherwise, we return the minimum length.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation efficiently handles the problem within the constraints, ensuring that it runs in linear time with respect to the size of the input array.\n"
