    "2530. Maximal Score After Applying K Operations\n",

    "      Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. You have a starting score of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    choose an index i such that 0 <= i < nums.length,\n",
    "    increase your score by nums[i], and\n",
    "    replace nums[i] with ceil(nums[i] / 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum possible score you can attain after applying exactly k operations.\n",

    "Explanation: Apply the operation to each array element exactly once. The final score is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.\n",

    "\n",

    "Output: 17\n",
    "Explanation: You can do the following operations:\n",
    "Operation 1: Select i = 1, so nums becomes [1,4,3,3,3]. Your score increases by 10.\n",
    "Operation 2: Select i = 1, so nums becomes [1,2,3,3,3]. Your score increases by 4.\n",
