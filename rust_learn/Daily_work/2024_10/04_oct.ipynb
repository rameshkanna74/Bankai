    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorting the Skill Array**: We first sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest skills, which helps in pairing players optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Target Skill Calculation**: We calculate the target skill by adding the smallest skill (`skill_sorted[0]`) and the largest skill (`skill_sorted[n - 1]`). This ensures that each team will have the same total skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Team Formation**: We loop through the first half of the sorted skill array, pairing the ith player from the start with the ith player from the end. If any pair does not match the target skill, we return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Chemistry Calculation**: If the pairing is valid, we calculate the chemistry for the team (product of skills) and accumulate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return Value**: Finally, we return the total chemistry after processing all pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sorting the skill array takes \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n",
    "- The pairing and summation take \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "- Overall, the time complexity is \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is \\(O(n)\\) due to the clone of the skill array for sorting.\n"

    "### Explanation of the Key Parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorting**: The `sort_unstable()` method is chosen for performance. It rearranges the array without guaranteeing the order of equal elements, which is sufficient for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pairing Logic**: The two pointers, `left` and `right`, are used to select pairs from the sorted list. This efficiently checks if the sum of the current pair matches the target sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chemistry Calculation**: The chemistry of each team is computed as the product of the skills of the two players, and results are summed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: The sorting step is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), and the pairing step is \\(O(n)\\). Therefore, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step: \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) if we consider the input list as part of the input space, or \\(O(n)\\) if we consider the temporary storage during sorting. Since we are not using any additional data structures that scale with input size, the space complexity is efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is clean and follows good practices for Rust programming, making it easy to understand and maintain. Well done!\n"
