    "2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries\n",

    "\n",
    "You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. You are also given an array queries of size m.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the ith query you do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.\n",
    "    The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]\n",
    "Output: [2]\n",
    "Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.\n",
    "The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).\n",

    "Output: [3,2,3,2]\n",
    "Explanation: We have the following queries:\n",
    "- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).\n",
    "- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).\n",
    "- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).\n",
