    "You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.\n",
    "        For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.\n",

    "Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.\n",

    "- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].\n",
    "- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].\n",
    "  The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.\n",
