    "1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence\n",

    "      Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: sentence = \"i love eating burger\", searchWord = \"burg\"\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation: \"burg\" is prefix of \"burger\" which is the 4th word in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: sentence = \"this problem is an easy problem\", searchWord = \"pro\"\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation: \"pro\" is prefix of \"problem\" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: sentence = \"i am tired\", searchWord = \"you\"\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation: \"you\" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= sentence.length <= 100\n",
    "    1 <= searchWord.length <= 10\n",
    "    sentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.\n",
    "    searchWord consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
