    "2558. Take Gifts From the Richest Pile\n",
    "      Easy\n",
    "      Topics\n",
    "      Companies\n",
    "      Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array gifts denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.\n",
    "    If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.\n",
    "    Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of gifts remaining after k seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4\n",
    "Output: 29\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The gifts are taken in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "- Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "- After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "- Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "  The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile.\n",
    "That is, you can't take any pile with you.\n",
    "So, the total gifts remaining are 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= gifts.length <= 103\n",
    "    1 <= gifts[i] <= 109\n",
    "    1 <= k <= 103\n",
