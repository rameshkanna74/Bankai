    "Given the string s, return the size of the longest substring containing each vowel an even number of times. That is, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' must appear an even number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"eleetminicoworoep\"\n",
    "Output: 13\n",
    "Explanation: The longest substring is \"leetminicowor\" which contains two each of the vowels: e, i and o and zero of the vowels: a and u.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"leetcodeisgreat\"\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: The longest substring is \"leetc\" which contains two e's.\n",

    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"bcbcbc\"\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: In this case, the given string \"bcbcbc\" is the longest because all vowels: a, e, i, o and u appear zero times.\n",

    "Constraints:\n",

    "    1 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^5\n",

    "The current solution you have is already very efficient with a **time complexity of O(n)**, which is optimal for this problem, as you process each character exactly once. The bitmask and the use of a hashmap ensure that the operations on each character (like toggling bits and hashmap lookups) are done in constant time, O(1). Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(32) or O(1), because the bitmask can only have 32 different states (2^5 for 5 vowels), and the hashmap at most stores 32 entries.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. Each character in the string is processed once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the constraints, the code is already highly efficient, and there isn't a faster approach in terms of time complexity. However, we can make minor improvements in code readability and structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minor Improvements:\n",
    "1. **Avoid unnecessary type conversions**: Instead of using `i as i32`, you can work directly with `i` since Rust’s `usize` is sufficient.\n",
    "2. **Refactor code for clarity**: You can slightly refactor the code for better readability by removing redundant comments and using `match` more concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the same code with these minor improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "use std::collections::HashMap;\n",
    "\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn find_the_longest_substring(s: String) -> i32 {\n",
    "        let mut first_occurrence = HashMap::new();\n",
    "        first_occurrence.insert(0, -1);  // Initial state for no vowels seen\n",
    "        \n",
    "        let mut bitmask = 0;\n",
    "        let mut max_length = 0;\n",
    "        \n",
    "        for (i, c) in s.chars().enumerate() {\n",
    "            // Toggle the corresponding bit for each vowel\n",
    "            bitmask ^= match c {\n",
    "                'a' => 1 << 0,\n",
    "                'e' => 1 << 1,\n",
    "                'i' => 1 << 2,\n",
    "                'o' => 1 << 3,\n",
    "                'u' => 1 << 4,\n",
    "                _ => 0,\n",
    "            };\n",
    "\n",
    "            // Check if the current bitmask has been seen before\n",
    "            if let Some(&prev_index) = first_occurrence.get(&bitmask) {\n",
    "                max_length = max_length.max(i as i32 - prev_index);\n",
    "            } else {\n",
    "                first_occurrence.insert(bitmask, i as i32);\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        max_length\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "- **Match expression inline**: We directly toggle the bitmask using the `match` result without needing to write separate statements.\n",
    "- **Simplified comments**: The code is self-explanatory with only essential comments, improving readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance:\n",
    "This version has the same time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1), but it’s slightly more concise and readable. You can't improve the time complexity further for this problem as O(n) is the best possible given the need to traverse each character of the input string."

    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bitmask for Vowels**:\n",
    "   We use a bitmask to track the parity (even or odd) of each vowel. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `'a'` corresponds to the least significant bit.\n",
    "   - `'e'` corresponds to the second bit.\n",
    "   - `'i'` corresponds to the third bit.\n",
    "   - `'o'` corresponds to the fourth bit.\n",
    "   - `'u'` corresponds to the fifth bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bitmask Manipulation**:\n",
    "   Every time we encounter a vowel, we toggle its corresponding bit. If the same bitmask occurs at two different positions, it means the vowels in between appear an even number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **First Occurrence Array**:\n",
    "   We store the first occurrence of each bitmask. If we encounter a bitmask that has appeared before, the substring between the first occurrence and the current position contains vowels in even counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\)\n",
    "   We traverse the string once, updating the bitmask and checking the first occurrence map in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Space Complexity**: \\( O(1) \\)\n",
    "   We use a fixed-size array (32 elements) for the first occurrence of each bitmask.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 1**: For `eleetminicoworoep`, the longest substring where vowels appear in even counts is `\"leetminicowor\"`, which has length 13.\n",
    "- **Example 2**: For `leetcodeisgreat`, the longest such substring is `\"leetc\"`, which has length 5.\n",
    "- **Example 3**: For `bcbcbc`, all vowels appear 0 times, so the whole string is the answer, with length 6.\n"
