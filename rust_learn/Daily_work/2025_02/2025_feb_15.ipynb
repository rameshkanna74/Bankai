    "Given a positive integer n, return the punishment number of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "The punishment number of n is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers i such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= i <= n\n",
    "The decimal representation of i \\* i can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 10\n",
    "Output: 182\n",
    "Explanation: There are exactly 3 integers i in the range [1, 10] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 since 1 \\* 1 = 1\n",
    "- 9 since 9 \\* 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 and 1 with a sum equal to 8 + 1 == 9.\n",
    "- 10 since 10 \\* 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 and 0 with a sum equal to 10 + 0 == 10.\n",
    "  Hence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182\n",
    "  Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 37\n",
    "Output: 1478\n",
    "Explanation: There are exactly 4 integers i in the range [1, 37] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 since 1 \\* 1 = 1.\n",
    "- 9 since 9 \\* 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 + 1.\n",
    "- 10 since 10 \\* 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 + 0.\n",
    "- 36 since 36 \\* 36 = 1296 and 1296 can be partitioned into 1 + 29 + 6.\n",
    "  Hence, the punishment number of 37 is 1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478\n",
