    "Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.\n",
    "Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.\n",
    "For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.\n",
    "The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.\n",
