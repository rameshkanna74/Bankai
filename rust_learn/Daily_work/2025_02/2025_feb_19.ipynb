    "1415. The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n\n",

    "A happy string is a string that:\n",
    "\n",
    "consists only of letters of the set ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n",
    "s[i] != s[i + 1] for all values of i from 1 to s.length - 1 (string is 1-indexed).\n",
    "For example, strings \"abc\", \"ac\", \"b\" and \"abcbabcbcb\" are all happy strings and strings \"aa\", \"baa\" and \"ababbc\" are not happy strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two integers n and k, consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 1, k = 3\n",
    "Output: \"c\"\n",
    "Explanation: The list [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is \"c\".\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 1, k = 4\n",
    "Output: \"\"\n",
    "Explanation: There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 3, k = 9\n",
    "Output: \"cab\"\n",
    "Explanation: There are 12 different happy string of length 3 [\"aba\", \"abc\", \"aca\", \"acb\", \"bab\", \"bac\", \"bca\", \"bcb\", \"cab\", \"cac\", \"cba\", \"cbc\"]. You will find the 9th string = \"cab\"\n",
