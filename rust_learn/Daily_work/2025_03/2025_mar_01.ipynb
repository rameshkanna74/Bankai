    "2460. Apply Operations to an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy\n",
    "Topics\n",
    "Companies\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed array nums of size n consisting of non-negative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to apply n - 1 operations to this array where, in the ith operation (0-indexed), you will apply the following on the ith element of nums:\n",
    "\n",
    "If nums[i] == nums[i + 1], then multiply nums[i] by 2 and set nums[i + 1] to 0. Otherwise, you skip this operation.\n",
    "After performing all the operations, shift all the 0's to the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the array [1,0,2,0,0,1] after shifting all its 0's to the end, is [1,2,1,0,0,0].\n",
    "Return the resulting array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the operations are applied sequentially, not all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]\n",
    "Output: [1,4,2,0,0,0]\n",
    "Explanation: We do the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.\n",
    "- i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0].\n",
    "- i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.\n",
    "- i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].\n",
    "- i = 4: nums[4] and nums[5] are equal, we multiply nums[4] by 2 and change nums[5] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].\n",
    "  After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array [1,4,2,0,0,0].\n",
    "  Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [0,1]\n",
    "Output: [1,0]\n",
    "Explanation: No operation can be applied, we just shift the 0 to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "2 <= nums.length <= 2000\n",
    "0 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n",
