    "2818. Apply Operations to Maximize Score\n",
    "      Hard\n",
    "      Topics\n",
    "      Companies\n",
    "      Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array nums of n positive integers and an integer k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, you start with a score of 1. You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most k times:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose any non-empty subarray nums[l, ..., r] that you haven't chosen previously.\n",
    "Choose an element x of nums[l, ..., r] with the highest prime score. If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index.\n",
    "Multiply your score by x.\n",
    "Here, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 300 = 2 _ 2 _ 3 _ 5 _ 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2\n",
    "Output: 81\n",
    "Explanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 1 \\* 9 = 9.\n",
    "- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 \\* 9 = 81.\n",
    "  It can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.\n",
    "  Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [19,12,14,6,10,18], k = 3\n",
    "Output: 4788\n",
    "Explanation: To get a score of 4788, we can apply the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose subarray nums[0, ..., 0]. nums[0] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score becomes 1 \\* 19 = 19.\n",
    "- Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5]. The score becomes 19 \\* 18 = 342.\n",
    "- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 2, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multipy the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 342 \\* 14 = 4788.\n",
    "  It can be proven that 4788 is the highest score one can obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= nums.length == n <= 105\n",
    "1 <= nums[i] <= 105\n",
    "1 <= k <= min(n \\* (n + 1) / 2, 109)\n",
