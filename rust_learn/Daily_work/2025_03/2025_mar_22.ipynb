    "You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n vertices, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices ai and bi.\n",

    "Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.\n",

    "A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.\n",

    "A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.\n",

    "Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]\n",

    "Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.\n",
