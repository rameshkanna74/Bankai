    "2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number\n",

    "A bit flip of a number x is choosing a bit in the binary representation of x and flipping it from either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, for x = 7, the binary representation is 111 and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get 110, flip the second bit from the right to get 101, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get 10111, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two integers start and goal, return the minimum number of bit flips to convert start to goal.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: start = 10, goal = 7\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:\n",

    "- Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.\n",
    "- Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.\n",
    "- Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111.\n",
    "  It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: start = 3, goal = 4\n",
    "Output: 3\n",

    "To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of bit flips required to convert one integer to another, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find the Difference**:\n",
    "   - To determine which bits need to be flipped, calculate the bitwise XOR between the two numbers. The XOR operation highlights the bits that are different between the two numbers.\n",
    "2. **Count the Number of 1s**:\n",
    "   - The result of the XOR operation will have bits set to `1` wherever the bits differ. Thus, counting the number of `1`s in the XOR result gives the minimum number of bit flips needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(\\text{number of bits})\\), which is constant time \\(O(1)\\) since the number of bits is fixed (32 bits for 32-bit integers).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) because we're using a constant amount of extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can implement this in Rust:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn min_bit_flips(start: i32, goal: i32) -> i32 {\n",
    "        // Compute the XOR of start and goal to find differing bits\n",

    "\n",
    "        // Count 1s by checking each bit of differing_bits\n",
    "        while number > 0 {\n",

    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **XOR Operation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `start ^ goal` produces a number where each bit is `1` if the corresponding bits of `start` and `goal` are different, and `0` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counting 1s**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We initialize `count` to keep track of the number of differing bits.\n",
    "   - We use a loop to iterate through each bit of the `differing_bits` number:\n",
    "     - `number & 1` checks if the least significant bit is `1`.\n",
    "     - `number >>= 1` shifts the number right by one bit to process the next bit.\n",
    "   - We add to `count` for every `1` found in the XOR result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Cases**:\n",
    "   - The `main` function demonstrates the solution with provided examples to verify correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that you efficiently compute the number of bit flips required to convert `start` to `goal` while keeping the implementation clear and concise.\n"

    "The solution I provided is already quite efficient for the problem at hand, as it operates in constant time and space with respect to the number of bits in the integer. The XOR operation and bit counting are both very efficient operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you're looking for a more concise or idiomatic way to achieve the same result in Rust, here's a version that leverages Rust's built-in functionality for counting bits:\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Efficient Rust Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust provides a method `count_ones` on the integer type that directly counts the number of `1` bits in the binary representation. This is optimized and avoids the explicit loop for counting bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can use `count_ones` to simplify and potentially make the code more efficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn min_bit_flips(start: i32, goal: i32) -> i32 {\n",
    "        // Compute the XOR of start and goal to find differing bits\n",
    "        let differing_bits = start ^ goal;\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of differing_bits\n",

    "    let start1 = 10;\n",
    "    let goal1 = 7;\n",
    "    println!(\"Output: {}\", Solution::min_bit_flips(start1, goal1)); // Output should be 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    let start2 = 3;\n",
    "    let goal2 = 4;\n",
    "    println!(\"Output: {}\", Solution::min_bit_flips(start2, goal2)); // Output should be 3\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **XOR Operation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `start ^ goal` gives us the bit difference between `start` and `goal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counting 1s**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `differing_bits.count_ones()` is a method provided by Rust's `u32` and `i32` integer types that counts the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of the integer. This method is highly optimized and directly gives the count of differing bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type Conversion**:\n",
    "   - The `count_ones` method returns a `u32`, so we need to cast it to `i32` to match the return type of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `count_ones` method is more idiomatic and potentially more optimized than manually counting bits with a loop. It leverages the underlying hardware or library optimizations for counting bits.\n",
    "- The overall complexity remains \\(O(1)\\), as the operations are constant time with respect to the number of bits in the integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This refined implementation maintains efficiency while making use of Rust’s powerful standard library functions for clarity and conciseness.\n"
