    "2070. Most Beautiful Item for Each Query\n",
    "      Medium\n",
    "      Topics\n",
    "      Companies\n",
    "      Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 2D integer array items where items[i] = [pricei, beautyi] denotes the price and beauty of an item respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given a 0-indexed integer array queries. For each queries[j], you want to determine the maximum beauty of an item whose price is less than or equal to queries[j]. If no such item exists, then the answer to this query is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n",
    "Output: [2,4,5,5,6,6]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.\n",
    "- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4].\n",
    "  The maximum beauty among them is 4.\n",
    "- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].\n",
    "  The maximum beauty among them is 5.\n",
    "- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.\n",
    "  Hence, the answer for them is the maximum beauty of all items, i.e., 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: items = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]], queries = [1]\n",
    "Output: [4]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The price of every item is equal to 1, so we choose the item with the maximum beauty 4.\n",
    "Note that multiple items can have the same price and/or beauty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: items = [[10,1000]], queries = [5]\n",
    "Output: [0]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "No item has a price less than or equal to 5, so no item can be chosen.\n",
    "Hence, the answer to the query is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= items.length, queries.length <= 105\n",
    "    items[i].length == 2\n",
    "    1 <= pricei, beautyi, queries[j] <= 109\n",
