    "You are given an integer n indicating there are n specialty retail stores. There are m product types of varying amounts, which are given as a 0-indexed integer array quantities, where quantities[i] represents the number of products of the ith product type.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to distribute all products to the retail stores following these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A store can only be given at most one product type but can be given any amount of it.\n",
    "    After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly 0). Let x represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want x to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to minimize the maximum number of products that are given to any store.\n",
