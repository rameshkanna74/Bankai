    "To solve this problem efficiently in Rust, we need to focus on both time and space complexity. Here's how we can approach the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Allowed characters**: Since the `allowed` string contains distinct characters, we can represent them as a set. Checking membership in a set has an average time complexity of O(1).\n",
    "2. **Words**: For each word in `words`, we can check if all characters in the word exist in the allowed set.\n",
    "3. **Optimal time complexity**: We aim for O(n \\* m), where `n` is the number of words, and `m` is the average length of the words. Checking each character in a word against a set is O(1), and this needs to be done for every character of every word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the `allowed` string into a `HashSet` to quickly check if a character is allowed.\n",
    "2. For each word, check if all of its characters exist in the `HashSet`.\n",
    "3. Count how many words are consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating the set from `allowed`: O(allowed.length), which is at most O(26), so it's constant time.\n",
    "- For each word, checking each character in the set takes O(word.length). For `n` words, the total complexity is O(n \\* m), where `m` is the average word length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need space to store the `HashSet`, which takes O(allowed.length). Since the length of `allowed` is at most 26, this is also constant O(1) space.\n",
    "- No additional significant space is required beyond the input itself.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`allowed_set`**: A `HashSet` is created from the `allowed` string. This allows O(1) lookups to check if a character is allowed.\n",
    "- **`consistent_count`**: We keep a count of how many words are consistent.\n",
    "- **`chars().all(...)`**: This method checks if all characters in a word satisfy the condition, i.e., whether they exist in the `allowed_set`. If all characters of the word are allowed, the word is considered consistent.\n",
    "- **Test cases in `main()`**: The function is tested with three example cases to demonstrate its correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n \\* m), where `n` is the number of words, and `m` is the average length of the words.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because the `allowed_set` can store at most 26 characters, which is constant space.\n"
