    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direction Handling**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The robot starts facing north, represented by the vector `(0, 1)`.\n",
    "   - We define direction vectors for north, east, south, and west. The robot's direction is tracked using an index (`direction_idx`), which we update with every left (`-2`) or right (`-1`) turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Obstacle Handling**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Obstacles are stored in a `HashSet` for O(1) lookups. This ensures the robot can quickly check if the next position is an obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Movement and Distance Calculation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each forward movement command, the robot checks if the next position is an obstacle. If not, the robot moves, and we calculate the Euclidean distance squared from the origin.\n",
    "   - The maximum distance squared encountered during the movement is tracked and returned at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)` where `n` is the number of commands and `m` is the number of obstacles. Each command is processed in constant time, and checking an obstacle is also constant time due to the `HashSet`.\n",
    "   - **Space Complexity**: `O(m)` due to the storage of obstacles in a `HashSet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `robot_sim` function with the provided examples.\n"
