    "Here’s an efficient Rust implementation of the solution for the \"Find Missing Observations\" problem with detailed comments explaining the code. We will aim for the best possible time and space complexity, considering the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sum Calculation**: The total sum of all the rolls (both given and missing) must equal `mean * (n + m)`, where `n` is the number of missing observations, and `m` is the number of given observations.\n",
    "2. **Remaining Sum**: Calculate the sum of the given rolls and subtract it from the total required sum to find the sum of the missing rolls.\n",
    "3. **Feasibility Check**: Ensure that the sum of the missing rolls is within the range `[n, 6 * n]`, since each die roll can only be between 1 and 6.\n",
    "4. **Distribute Missing Rolls**: Distribute the sum evenly among the missing rolls, ensuring each roll is between 1 and 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the Rust code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **total_sum_needed**: This is the sum of all dice rolls that should be reached to achieve the desired mean.\n",
    "- **missing_sum**: The sum of the missing rolls that must be distributed.\n",
    "- **Feasibility check**: If the `missing_sum` is not within the bounds `[n, 6 * n]`, it's impossible to get the desired outcome.\n",
    "- **Distribution of missing_sum**: Start by filling each missing roll with 1, and then distribute the remainder (`remaining_sum`) by incrementing the rolls, ensuring each is between 1 and 6.\n",
