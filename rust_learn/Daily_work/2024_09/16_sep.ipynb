    "Here's an optimized solution to the \"Minimum Time Difference\" problem. We can achieve the best time complexity by converting each time point to the total number of minutes since midnight. Once all times are converted, we sort the list, and then calculate the difference between consecutive times. The smallest difference will be the result, taking into account the circular nature of the clock (i.e., the difference between the last and first times).\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert Time to Minutes**:\n",
    "   We first convert each time in `HH:MM` format to the total number of minutes since midnight. This simplifies the calculation since we can now work with integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"23:59\"` becomes `23 * 60 + 59 = 1439` minutes.\n",
    "   - `\"00:00\"` becomes `0 * 60 + 0 = 0` minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sort the Time Points**:\n",
    "   After converting the times to minutes, we sort the list to ensure we can easily compare consecutive times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Minimum Difference**:\n",
    "   We calculate the difference between each consecutive pair of times and keep track of the smallest difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle Circular Nature of Time**:\n",
    "   Since the time format is circular (the day resets after 24 hours), we also need to calculate the difference between the last and the first time. The total number of minutes in a day is 1440, so the difference between the last and first time is calculated as `1440 - (last - first)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return the Minimum Difference**:\n",
    "   The result is the smallest difference found during the comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n \\log n) \\) due to the sorting step where \\( n \\) is the number of time points.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\) for storing the converted minute representations of time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 1**: `\"23:59\"` and `\"00:00\"` are 1 minute apart, so the result is 1.\n",
    "- **Example 2**: Since `\"00:00\"` appears twice, the minimum difference is 0."
