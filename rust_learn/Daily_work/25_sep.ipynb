    "      Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array words of size n consisting of non-empty strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the score of a string word as the number of strings words[i] such that word is a prefix of words[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if words = [\"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"cab\"], then the score of \"ab\" is 2, since \"ab\" is a prefix of both \"ab\" and \"abc\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the sum of scores of every non-empty prefix of words[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: words = [\"abc\",\"ab\",\"bc\",\"b\"]\n",
    "Output: [5,4,3,2]\n",
    "Explanation: The answer for each string is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"abc\" has 3 prefixes: \"a\", \"ab\", and \"abc\".\n",
    "- There are 2 strings with the prefix \"a\", 2 strings with the prefix \"ab\", and 1 string with the prefix \"abc\".\n",
    "  The total is answer[0] = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n",
    "- \"ab\" has 2 prefixes: \"a\" and \"ab\".\n",
    "- There are 2 strings with the prefix \"a\", and 2 strings with the prefix \"ab\".\n",
    "  The total is answer[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.\n",
    "- \"bc\" has 2 prefixes: \"b\" and \"bc\".\n",
    "- There are 2 strings with the prefix \"b\", and 1 string with the prefix \"bc\".\n",
    "  The total is answer[2] = 2 + 1 = 3.\n",
    "- \"b\" has 1 prefix: \"b\".\n",
    "- There are 2 strings with the prefix \"b\".\n",
    "  The total is answer[3] = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: words = [\"abcd\"]\n",
    "Output: [4]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\"abcd\" has 4 prefixes: \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\", and \"abcd\".\n",
    "Each prefix has a score of one, so the total is answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    1 <= words.length <= 1000\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "1. **Prefix Count Calculation**:\n",
    "   - We use a `HashMap` to count occurrences of each prefix. As we iterate through each word, we generate all possible prefixes by slicing the word from the beginning to each character.\n",
    "   - For each prefix, we increment its count in the hashmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Score Calculation**:\n",
    "   - We initialize an empty vector `result` to store the scores for each word.\n",
    "   - For each word, we calculate its total score by summing up the counts of all its prefixes using the hashmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - This approach efficiently calculates scores in two passes: one for counting prefixes and another for calculating the scores based on those counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words. This is due to generating all prefixes for each word.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the total number of unique prefixes, which can be at most the total number of characters across all words. In the worst case, this is also O(n * m) when every prefix is unique."

    "### Explanation of the Optimized Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trie Structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We define a `TrieNode` struct that contains a count of how many words pass through this node and a hashmap of children nodes.\n",
    "   - The `Trie` struct has a root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inserting Words**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - When inserting a word, we traverse each character and insert it into the Trie. For each character, we increment the count of the prefix (which is represented by the path from the root to that node).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculating Scores**:\n",
    "   - For each word, we calculate its total score by summing the counts of all prefixes using the Trie. This is done in a single traversal of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n \\* m), where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word. Each word is processed in linear time relative to its length.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique prefixes. The Trie efficiently stores prefixes and their counts. This can be significantly less than O(n \\* m) in cases where many prefixes are shared.\n"
