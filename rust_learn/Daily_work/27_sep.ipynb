    "You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.\n",

    "A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).\n",

    "The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure Definition**: The `MyCalendarTwo` struct contains a `HashMap` called `events`, which tracks how many events are occurring at each time point.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constructor (`new`)**: Initializes a new instance of `MyCalendarTwo` with an empty `events` map.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Booking Method (`book`)**:\n",
    "   - It first checks for overlaps with existing events using the `events` map.\n",
    "   - For every time point in the range of the new event, it checks how many events are currently active.\n",
    "   - If adding the new event would cause any time point to have three or more overlapping events, the booking is rejected (returns `false`).\n",
    "   - If there are no issues, it updates the `events` map with the new event range by incrementing the count for each point in the range `[start, end)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overall complexity of the `book` function is approximately \\(O(N)\\) where \\(N\\) is the number of time points in the new booking. Given that we might need to check overlaps against the current events, the worst case would also involve all time points being checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is \\(O(N)\\) for storing the booking counts in the `HashMap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation effectively manages bookings while avoiding triple overlaps, and it should perform well within the problem's constraints.\n"
