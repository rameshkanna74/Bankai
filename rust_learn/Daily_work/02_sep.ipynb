    "1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk\n",
    "\n",
    "There are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",

    "Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:\n",

    "- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.\n",
    "- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.\n",

    "Your implementation of the `chalk_replacer` function in Rust is almost correct. However, there is one potential issue with the handling of large values of `k` where `k` could be larger than `i32`. To address this, I'll suggest some improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use `i64` for Accumulation**: To avoid overflow when calculating the total chalk and accumulated chalk, especially when `k` is large, itâ€™s safer to use `i64` for calculations.\n",
    "2. **Avoid Redundant Fallback**: The fallback `-1` return statement is not necessary because the function's logic guarantees that a student index will always be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the improved code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn chalk_replacer(chalk: Vec<i32>, k: i32) -> i32 {\n",
    "        // Step 1: Calculate total chalk required for one full cycle of students\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Improvements:\n",
    "1. **Handling Large Numbers**: By using `i64` instead of `i32` for `total_chalk`, `remaining_chalk`, and `accumulated_chalk`, the code handles cases where `k` or the sum of `chalk` elements could be large without causing overflow.\n",
    "2. **Removing Redundant Fallback**: The `unreachable!()` macro is used to indicate that the code should never reach that point, which improves clarity and prevents unnecessary code.\n",
    "3. **Safe Casting**: Casts from `i32` to `i64` are used when summing or iterating, ensuring that larger values are handled correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the function behaves correctly even with large inputs."
