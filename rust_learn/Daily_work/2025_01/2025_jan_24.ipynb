    "There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].\n",

    "   ```rust\n",
    "   println!(\"Initial states: {:?}\", states);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DFS Start**: Each time we start DFS on a node, we print a message indicating the node we are processing.\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   println!(\"\\nStarting DFS for node {}\", i);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DFS for Each Node**: After completing DFS for a node, the state of the `states` array is printed so you can see how it changes after processing that node.\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   println!(\"States after DFS for node {}: {:?}\", i, states);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **State of a Node**: When a node is already processed (visited), the code prints the state it has.\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   println!(\"Node {} already processed. Returning state {}\", node, states[node]);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Marking a Node as Visiting**: When a node is marked as \"visiting\" (i.e., being processed in the current DFS path), we print that action.\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   println!(\"Visiting node {}: Marking as visiting (1)\", node);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cycle Detection**: If a cycle is detected (when visiting a node that's already in the current DFS path), a message is printed.\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   println!(\"Cycle detected at node {}, marking as unsafe (1)\", node);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Unsafe Node**: If any of the neighbors lead to an unsafe state, the node is marked as unsafe and a message is printed.\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   println!(\"Neighbor {} is unsafe, marking node {} as unsafe (1)\", neighbor, node);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Marking Node as Safe**: When a node is confirmed to be safe (all paths lead to safe nodes), we print that it is safe.\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   println!(\"Node {} is safe, marking as safe (2)\", node);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Final Safe Nodes**: Finally, we print the safe nodes that are returned.\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   println!(\"\\nFinal safe nodes: {:?}\", safe_nodes);\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "    vec![], \n",
    "    vec![]\n",
    "];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initial states: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting DFS for node 0\n",

    "Final safe nodes: [2, 4, 5, 6]\n",

    "\n",
    "This debugging output helps track how the state of each node changes during the DFS process, how cycles are detected, and when nodes are marked as safe or unsafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "This debugging version with `println!()` statements will help you visualize and understand the flow of the DFS traversal, how nodes are processed, and how the `states` array evolves. This approach is useful for both interviews and debugging in general."

    "The problem you solved involves **detecting safe nodes** in a directed graph, which relates to a **graph traversal** problem, specifically using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** with **cycle detection** and **memoization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key patterns and concepts you can learn from this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Graph Traversal (DFS)**:\n",
    "   - The main pattern here is **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. DFS is a common graph traversal technique used to explore all nodes and edges of a graph.\n",
    "   - You traverse from each node, marking its status to keep track of its state (whether it's safe or not).\n",
    "   - **DFS** can be implemented recursively (as shown in the solution) or iteratively using an explicit stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Cycle Detection**:\n",
    "   - A key feature of this problem is detecting whether a node (or a path) is part of a **cycle**. If a node is revisited in the DFS traversal, it means you've encountered a cycle, and the node cannot be safe (because a cycle would lead to an infinite loop).\n",
    "   - You detect cycles using the **visiting** state (`1`), where nodes in the current DFS path are temporarily marked as \"visiting.\"\n",
    "   - If you encounter a node that is already in the \"visiting\" state, you've detected a cycle, and the current node cannot be marked as safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Memoization (Storing States)**:\n",
    "   - Memoization is used to optimize the DFS traversal by storing the results of previous calculations. In this problem, we store the state of each node (whether it is unvisited, visiting, or safe).\n",
    "   - This avoids redundant checks for the same node, improving the efficiency of the algorithm, especially for larger graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Marking Nodes with States**:\n",
    "   - You use three states to classify nodes:\n",
    "     - `0`: Unvisited (node hasn't been processed).\n",
    "     - `1`: Visiting (node is part of the current DFS path, i.e., being processed).\n",
    "     - `2`: Safe (all paths lead to terminal or safe nodes).\n",
    "   - This is a common approach for handling graphs where nodes can have different statuses or classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Topological Sorting (Implicit)**:\n",
    "   - Although this problem doesn't directly ask for a topological sort, the concept is closely related. You are essentially marking nodes as \"safe\" (which could be thought of as a form of topological order), since all paths from a safe node lead to other safe nodes or terminal nodes.\n",
    "   - In problems like these, topological sorting often comes into play when determining the safe or final order of nodes (such as in the case of resolving dependencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Backtracking**:\n",
    "   - While not strictly a backtracking problem, this problem does share some similarities with backtracking because you're making recursive decisions and then \"undoing\" those decisions (via state changes) as you backtrack through the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Graph Theory Concepts**:\n",
    "   - **Terminal Nodes**: A node with no outgoing edges is a terminal node. These are inherently safe because they do not lead anywhere.\n",
    "   - **Safe Nodes**: Nodes that can eventually reach terminal nodes without falling into a cycle are considered safe. You must determine which nodes are safe by considering all possible paths.\n",
    "   - **Strongly Connected Components (SCC)**: While this problem doesn't explicitly use SCCs, detecting cycles in a directed graph and marking nodes as safe or unsafe shares a concept with SCC detection. SCC algorithms (like Tarjan's or Kosaraju's) identify strongly connected subgraphs where each node is reachable from every other node in that subgraph. If any SCC contains a cycle, the nodes in that SCC are unsafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Pathfinding in Directed Graphs**:\n",
    "   - This problem is a variant of pathfinding where you are not just looking for the shortest or any path, but instead looking to categorize nodes based on their ability to reach terminal states without cycles. This highlights how pathfinding can be extended to problems where the structure of paths themselves (such as cycles or safety) matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Patterns:\n",
    "- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** for graph traversal.\n",
    "- **Cycle Detection** using node states (`visiting`, `safe`).\n",
    "- **Memoization** (storing the results of DFS for each node).\n",
    "- **Topological Sorting (implicitly)** in terms of finding safe nodes.\n",
    "- **Backtracking** through recursive calls (similar to how DFS works).\n",
    "- **Graph Theory** concepts like terminal nodes and safe nodes.\n",
    "- **Pathfinding** techniques in directed graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications:\n",
    "This pattern is commonly used in:\n",
    "- **Dependency Resolution** (like task scheduling, project management tools).\n",
    "- **Finding Safe Nodes** (for example, in network routing to find safe paths).\n",
    "- **Detecting Cycles in Directed Graphs** (in problems related to deadlocks, dependency cycles, etc.).\n"
