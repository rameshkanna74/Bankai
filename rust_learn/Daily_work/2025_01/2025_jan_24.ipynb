    "There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).\n",
