    "      Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.\n",
    "\n",
    "A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\".\n",
