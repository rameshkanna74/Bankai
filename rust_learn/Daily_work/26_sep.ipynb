    "\n",
    "You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.\n",
    "\n",
    "A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the MyCalendar class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.\n",
    "    boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We use a `BTreeMap<i32, i32>` called `bookings`. This allows us to store the start and end times of events while maintaining the order, which is helpful for efficiently checking overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constructor (`new`)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Initializes a new `MyCalendar` instance with an empty `BTreeMap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Booking Method (`book`)**:\n",
    "   - The method takes a `start` and `end` time as arguments.\n",
    "   - It iterates over existing bookings using a range that includes all events that could overlap with the new event.\n",
    "   - For each existing event, it checks if the new event overlaps with it. If it does, it returns `false`.\n",
    "   - If no overlaps are found, it inserts the new booking into the map and returns `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Book Method**: O(log n + k), where n is the number of existing bookings and k is the number of overlapping bookings (in practice, this is efficient due to the sorted nature of the `BTreeMap`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- O(n) for storing the bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main` function demonstrates creating an instance of `MyCalendar`, adding bookings, and printing the results to verify correctness. You can run this code in any Rust environment.\n"
