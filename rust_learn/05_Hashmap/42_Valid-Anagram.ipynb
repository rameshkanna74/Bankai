    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Length Check**: First, we check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they differ, they cannot be anagrams, so we return `false` immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Character Frequency Count**: We create an array `char_count` of size 26 (for each lowercase English letter) initialized to zero. This array will keep track of the frequency of each character in the string `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Counting Characters**:\n",
    "   - We iterate through each character in string `s` and increment the corresponding index in `char_count`. The index for each character is calculated using `char as usize - 'a' as usize`, which maps 'a' to 0, 'b' to 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decreasing Frequency**:\n",
    "   - For each character in string `t`, we decrement the corresponding index in `char_count`. If any count goes below zero, it indicates that `t` has more of that character than `s`, hence we return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Check**: If we finish iterating through both strings without returning `false`, they must be anagrams, so we return `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the strings. We perform a single pass through both strings.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use a fixed-size array of 26 elements for the character counts."
