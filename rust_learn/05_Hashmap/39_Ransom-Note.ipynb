    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Count Characters in Magazine**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use a `HashMap` to count occurrences of each character in `magazine`. The `or_insert(0)` method ensures that if the character is not already in the map, it starts with a count of 0, which is then incremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Ransom Note Characters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Iterate over each character in `ransom_note` and check if it is present in the `HashMap` with a non-zero count. If a character is missing or its count is zero, return `false`.\n",
    "   - If the character is found, decrement its count in the `HashMap` to reflect that one occurrence has been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return True**:\n",
    "   - If the loop completes without returning `false`, it means all characters in `ransom_note` are present in sufficient quantity in `magazine`, so return `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n + m)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of `ransom_note` and \\(m\\) is the length of `magazine`. This is because we traverse each string once: once for counting characters in `magazine` and once for checking characters in `ransom_note`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(k)\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of unique characters in `magazine`. This space is used by the `HashMap` to store character counts. In the worst case, this is \\(O(1)\\) as there are only 26 lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints well.\n"

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Array-based Counting**:\n",

    "   - We increment the count for each character in the magazine.\n",
    "   - This approach reduces the overhead from using a `HashMap` and improves performance, especially when dealing with a large number of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Checking Ransom Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each character in the ransom note, we check if there are enough occurrences in the `char_count` array. If any character has insufficient occurrences, we return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n + m) \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We process the `magazine` in \\( O(m) \\) and the `ransom_note` in \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are the lengths of the ransom note and magazine, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Space Complexity**: \\( O(1) \\)\n",
    "   - We use a constant amount of extra space (the array of size 26), regardless of the size of the input.\n",

    "This optimized version is more efficient due to the fixed-size array, making it faster for the specific problem domain.\n"
