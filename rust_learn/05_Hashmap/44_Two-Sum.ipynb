    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We only traverse the list once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the additional space used by the HashMap to store the elements and their indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HashMap Initialization**: We use a `HashMap` to store the elements we have seen so far and their indices. This allows for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating Over the Array**: We loop through the array using `enumerate`, which gives us both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`) of each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Finding the Complement**: For each element, we calculate its complement by subtracting it from the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Checking the Complement in HashMap**: If the complement exists in the HashMap, it means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. We then return their indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inserting into HashMap**: If the complement is not found, we store the current element and its index in the HashMap for future reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Unreachable Code**: The problem guarantees that there is exactly one solution, so theoretically, the code should never reach beyond the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main` function runs the solution on the provided examples to demonstrate its correctness.\n"

    "In Rust, `isize` and `usize` are integer types that are used to represent sizes and indices. They have some important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `isize` vs. `usize`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signed vs. Unsigned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `isize` is a signed integer type, meaning it can represent both positive and negative numbers.\n",
    "   - `usize` is an unsigned integer type, meaning it can only represent non-negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `isize` is typically used when you need to represent a number that can be negative, such as offsets or differences in values.\n",
    "   - `usize` is used for sizes and indexing, where negative numbers do not make sense, such as array indices and the length of collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Size:**\n",
    "   - Both `isize` and `usize` are platform-dependent. They have the same size as the platformâ€™s pointer width.\n",
    "   - On a 32-bit system, both `isize` and `usize` are 32 bits.\n",
    "   - On a 64-bit system, both `isize` and `usize` are 64 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`isize`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Useful for calculations where negative values are possible, such as when working with differences or distances.\n",
    "  - For example, in a function that calculates the offset from a starting index, `isize` might be used to represent both positive and negative offsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`usize`:**\n",
    "  - Commonly used for indexing into arrays and slices, as well as representing sizes or lengths. Since indices cannot be negative, `usize` is the appropriate choice.\n",
    "  - For example, when iterating over elements in a vector, you typically use `usize` to access the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example illustrating the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let index: usize = 5; // Indexing into an array\n",
    "    let offset: isize = -2; // Offset for moving backward in an array\n",
    "\n",
    "    let array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];\n",
    "    let new_index = (index as isize + offset) as usize;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Access the element at the new index\n",
    "    if new_index < array.len() {\n",
    "        println!(\"Value at new index: {}\", array[new_index]);\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        println!(\"Index out of bounds\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`isize`**: Signed, used for calculations that may involve negative numbers.\n",
    "- **`usize`**: Unsigned, used for sizes and indexing where negative values are not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between `isize` and `usize` depends on whether you need to represent negative values or just non-negative indices and sizes.\n"
