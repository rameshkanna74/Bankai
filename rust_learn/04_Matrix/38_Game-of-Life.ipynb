    "According to Wikipedia's article: \"The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n",
    "    Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "    Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n",
    "    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\n",
    "Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]\n",

    "    Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\n",
    "    In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?\n",

    "To solve the \"Game of Life\" problem in Rust, where the goal is to update the board in-place based on Conway's Game of Life rules, you can use a clever encoding technique. This approach ensures you meet the constraints and update the board efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoding States**:\n",
    "   - We use a special encoding to represent both the current state and the next state of each cell:\n",
    "     - `0` represents a dead cell that will stay dead.\n",
    "     - `1` represents a live cell that will stay alive.\n",
    "     - `2` represents a dead cell that will become alive (next state: alive).\n",
    "     - `3` represents a live cell that will die (next state: dead).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counting Neighbors**:\n",
    "   - For each cell, count its live neighbors using the original state of the cell and its neighbors.\n",
    "   - Update the cell’s state based on the rules of the game, using the encoded states.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decoding States**:\n",
    "   - After processing all cells, decode the board to get the final state by converting encoded values back to `0` or `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(m \\times n)\\), where \\(m\\) is the number of rows and \\(n\\) is the number of columns. Each cell is processed in constant time.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) additional space, as we are updating the board in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Implementation:\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",

    "1. **Direction Array**:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Counting Neighbors**:\n",
    "   - The `count_live_neighbors` function checks all 8 possible neighbors and counts how many are alive (either `1` or `3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Updating States**:\n",
    "   - The board is first updated to encode the next state based on the current state and the number of live neighbors.\n",
    "   - After processing all cells, decode the board to get the final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures you handle the board in-place, efficiently updating all cells based on the rules of the Game of Life."

    "### Key Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Pass Encoding**:\n",
