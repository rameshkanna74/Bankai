    "### Explanation of Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stack Usage**: The stack keeps track of the signs for the current level of parentheses. When we encounter a `(`, we push the current sign onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sign Management**: The `sign` variable is updated based on whether we encounter a `+` or `-`. The `scope` variable flips to handle nested expressions, allowing us to correctly interpret the sign of results inside parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Number Parsing**: The digits are parsed from the string by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the new digit, which allows for multi-digit numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Calculation**: At the end of the loop, we need to add any remaining number to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Code\n",
    "You can run the above code in a Rust environment. It will evaluate the example expressions and print the results to the console."
