    "134. Gas Station\n",
    "\n",
    "There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\n",
    "Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8\n",
    "Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7\n",
    "Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6\n",
    "Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\n",
    "Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.\n",
    "Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.\n",
    "Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\n",
    "Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3\n",
    "Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3\n",
    "You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.\n",
    "Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    n == gas.length == cost.length\n",
    "    1 <= n <= 105\n",

    "To solve the problem of finding the starting gas station index where you can complete the circular route, we can use a greedy approach. The idea is to find the point where the total gas in the tank starts to be non-negative and from which you can complete the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "1. **Calculate Total Gas and Total Cost:** First, check if the total gas available is at least as much as the total cost required to complete the loop. If not, it's impossible to complete the circuit.\n",
    "2. **Greedy Search for Starting Index:** Iterate through the stations and maintain a current balance of gas. If at any point the current balance goes negative, it indicates that you cannot start from the current starting index. Reset the starting index to the next station and continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the gas array, due to the single pass through the array.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** \\(O(1)\\), as we are using only a few extra variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- **Total Gas vs. Total Cost:** Ensure that the total amount of gas is greater than or equal to the total cost. If not, return -1.\n",
    "- **Greedy Reset:** Use a greedy approach to reset the starting index whenever the current balance of gas goes negative. This ensures that only valid starting indices are considered.\n",
