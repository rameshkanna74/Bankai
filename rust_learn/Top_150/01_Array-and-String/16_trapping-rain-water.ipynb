    "\n",
    "Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.\n",

    "To solve the problem of trapping rainwater given an elevation map, we can use the **two-pointer technique** to achieve an optimal solution with \\(O(n)\\) time complexity and \\(O(1)\\) space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to traverse the elevation map from both ends towards the center.\n",
    "2. **Track Maximum Heights:** Maintain two variables, `left_max` and `right_max`, to track the maximum heights encountered so far from the left and right ends respectively.\n",
    "3. **Calculate Trapped Water:** Move the pointers towards each other. At each step, update the `left_max` and `right_max`, and calculate the trapped water based on the current height and the maximum heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the `height` vector.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** \\(O(1)\\), as only a few extra variables are used.\n",

    "1. **Initialization:** Set up pointers `left` and `right` and variables for tracking the maximum heights and total trapped water.\n",
    "2. **Traversal:** Compare heights at the `left` and `right` pointers.\n",

    "   - If the height at `right` is smaller, check if it is greater than or equal to `right_max`. If not, calculate the trapped water at the `right` position.\n",
    "3. **Update Pointers:** Move the pointers towards each other until they meet.\n",
    "4. **Return Result:** Sum up the trapped water.\n",
