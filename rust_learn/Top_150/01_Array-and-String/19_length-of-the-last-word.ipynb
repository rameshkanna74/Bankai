    "To solve the problem of finding the length of the last word in a string efficiently, we can approach it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "1. **Trim Trailing Spaces:** Start by trimming any trailing spaces from the string. This ensures that the last word is followed by the end of the string.\n",
    "2. **Find the Last Word:** Once the string is trimmed, iterate backward to find the start of the last word.\n",
    "3. **Calculate the Length:** Count the characters of the last word by continuing to move backward until a space is encountered or the start of the string is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the string. This is because, in the worst case, we may need to iterate through the entire string.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** \\(O(1)\\), since we only need a few additional variables for counting and iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the Rust implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    /// Finds the length of the last word in the given string `s`.\n",
    "    ///\n",
    "    /// # Arguments\n",
    "    ///\n",
    "    /// * `s` - A string containing words separated by spaces.\n",

    "        for ch in s.chars().rev() {\n",
    "            if ch != ' ' {\n",
    "                in_word = true;  // We've found a non-space character, so we're in a word\n",
    "                length += 1;     // Increment the length of the last word\n",
    "            } else if in_word {\n",
    "                // If we encounter a space after finding the last word, we're done\n",
    "                break;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        \n",
    "        length\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Example cases\n",
    "    let s1 = \"Hello World\".to_string();\n",
    "    let s2 = \" fly me to the moon \".to_string();\n",
    "    let s3 = \"luffy is still joyboy\".to_string();\n",
    "    \n",
    "    println!(\"Last word length: {}\", Solution::length_of_last_word(s1)); // Output: 5\n",
    "    println!(\"Last word length: {}\", Solution::length_of_last_word(s2)); // Output: 4\n",
    "    println!(\"Last word length: {}\", Solution::length_of_last_word(s3)); // Output: 6\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "1. **Iterate Backward:** By iterating backward through the string, we can directly locate the last word without needing to split the entire string or process leading spaces.\n",
    "2. **In-Word Flag:** The `in_word` flag ensures that we start counting only when we enter the last word, and it allows us to stop counting as soon as we exit that word (encounter a space).\n",
    "3. **Efficiency:** The method is efficient because it avoids unnecessary space usage and minimizes the operations needed to find the last word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is concise, clear, and well-suited for large input strings as it operates in linear time with constant space."
