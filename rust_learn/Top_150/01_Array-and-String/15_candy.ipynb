    "To solve the problem of distributing the minimum number of candies to children based on their ratings while satisfying the given conditions, we can use a two-pass approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Left-to-Right Pass:** Ensure that each child has more candies than their left neighbor if their rating is higher.\n",
    "2. **Right-to-Left Pass:** Ensure that each child has more candies than their right neighbor if their rating is higher. This pass will adjust the candy count based on the previous left-to-right pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "- **Initialization:** Start by giving each child one candy.\n",
    "- **Left-to-Right Pass:** Traverse the list from left to right, and if a child has a higher rating than their left neighbor, increase their candy count.\n",
    "- **Right-to-Left Pass:** Traverse the list from right to left, and if a child has a higher rating than their right neighbor, adjust the candy count to ensure the condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of children, due to the two linear passes over the array.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** \\(O(n)\\), due to the space needed to store the candy counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s the Rust implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    /// Returns the minimum number of candies needed to distribute according to the ratings.\n",
    "    /// \n",
