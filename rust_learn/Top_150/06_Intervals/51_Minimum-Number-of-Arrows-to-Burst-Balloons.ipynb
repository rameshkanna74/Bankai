    "There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "1. **Input Handling**: We first check if the `points` vector is empty. If it is, we return `0` since no arrows are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sorting**: We sort the `points` by the end coordinate of each balloon. This is crucial because it allows us to efficiently determine when a new arrow is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - We start with `arrows` set to `1`, as we need at least one arrow to burst the first balloon.\n",
    "   - We also initialize `last_arrow_position` to the end of the first balloon.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iteration**:\n",
    "   - We iterate through the sorted list of balloons starting from the second one.\n",
    "   - If the start of the current balloon (`sorted_points[i][0]`) is greater than `last_arrow_position`, it indicates that the current balloon cannot be burst by the last arrow, and we need a new one. We increment the arrow count and update `last_arrow_position` to the end of the current balloon.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the count of arrows needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- The sorting step takes \\(O(n \\log n)\\), and the iteration through the points takes \\(O(n)\\), making the overall time complexity \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- The space complexity is \\(O(n)\\) due to the storage of the sorted points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation efficiently determines the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons based on the given constraints."

    "### Key Optimizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid unnecessary cloning**: Instead of cloning the `points` vector, we can directly sort the original `points` in-place.\n",
    "2. **Reduce bound checks**: Instead of using array indexing, using destructuring for the sorted points can reduce potential bound checks and improve readability.\n",

    "### Changes and Optimizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-place sorting**: We passed `points` as `mut` and sorted it directly, avoiding the need for `clone`.\n",
    "2. **Destructuring**: The `point` is destructured into `start` and `end`, which reduces the need for index lookups (`point[0]` and `point[1]`).\n",
    "3. **Edge case handling**: The check for an empty list (`points.is_empty()`) is still included at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: \\(O(n \\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of balloons, due to sorting. The iteration through the points is \\(O(n)\\), which is minimal compared to sorting.\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) additional space, since we are sorting the array in-place and not using extra memory for cloning.\n",
    "\n",
