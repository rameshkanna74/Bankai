Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List\n","      Medium\n","      Topics\n","      Companies\n","      Hint\n","\n","In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.\n","\n","    For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.\n","\n","The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.\n","\n","Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.\n","\n","Example 1:\n","\n","Input: head = [5,4,2,1]\n","Output: 6\n","Explanation:\n","Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively.
