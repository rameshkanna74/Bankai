    "### DSA Concepts Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Two Pointers / Iterative Traversal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The concept of \"merging\" by iterating through both strings simultaneously is analogous to a two-pointer technique often used in merging arrays or linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **String Manipulation**:\n",
    "   - Leveraging efficient string methods like `push`, `push_str`, and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Concepts Were Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternating Merge**: The problem required interleaving elements from two inputs, which is naturally suited for a \"two-pointer\" or \"parallel traversal\" approach.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Direct manipulation of the string via appends and slices avoids the need for unnecessary intermediate data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When This Knowledge Is Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Merging Problems**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This technique is commonly used in problems where two data structures need to be interleaved or merged in some order, such as merging two sorted arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient Traversal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - When dealing with two iterables of varying lengths, understanding how to handle mismatched lengths efficiently is a transferable skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real-world Applications**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Tasks like data formatting, combining multiple data streams, or generating reports often require merging data alternately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalable Solutions**:\n",
    "   - The \\(O(\\text{len1} + \\text{len2})\\) time and space complexity ensures this approach works well even as the input sizes grow, as long as the constraints fit into memory.\n"
