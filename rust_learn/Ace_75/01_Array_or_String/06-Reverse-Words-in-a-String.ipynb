    "### **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "The time complexity of this solution is \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the input string `s`. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "- **`split_whitespace()`**: It splits the string by whitespace, which takes \\(O(n)\\) time.\n",
    "- **`rev()`**: Reversing the iterator also takes \\(O(m)\\), where \\(m\\) is the number of words in the string. Since \\(m \\leq n\\), this is at most \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "- **`collect::<Vec<&str>>()`**: Collecting the reversed iterator into a vector of words also takes \\(O(m)\\) time, and \\(m \\leq n\\), so it's \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "- **`join(\" \")`**: Joining the vector of words back into a string requires concatenating them, which takes \\(O(n)\\) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall time complexity is \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "The space complexity is also \\(O(n)\\), because we are storing the words in a vector (using `collect::<Vec<&str>>()`) and creating a new string with `join(\" \")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`split_whitespace()`** creates an iterator, but no extra space is used beyond the words themselves.\n",
    "- **`collect::<Vec<&str>>()`** stores the words in a vector.\n",
    "- **`join(\" \")`** creates the final string, which takes \\(O(n)\\) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the space complexity is \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **DSA Concept Used**:\n",
    "- **String Manipulation**: The primary technique here is splitting a string, reversing the order of the words, and joining them back. This is an example of string manipulation, a fundamental operation often required in coding problems.\n",
    "- **Iterators**: The solution makes heavy use of iterators, which is a key concept in Rust. The `rev()`, `split_whitespace()`, and `join()` methods are all iterators that allow for clean and efficient transformations on sequences of elements.\n",
    "- **Functional Programming Concepts**: The solution uses functional programming patterns such as chaining operations on iterators. This makes the code both compact and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Approach is Suitable for This Problem**:\n",
    "- **Conciseness**: The solution is short and highly readable, making it easy to understand and implement. It takes full advantage of Rust’s iterator methods, which allow transforming and processing collections in a concise way.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: The approach avoids manually handling strings and spaces, leveraging Rust’s efficient built-in methods for splitting, reversing, and joining. This leads to a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\), which is optimal for this problem.\n",
    "- **Rust’s Strength**: This solution takes full advantage of Rust’s ability to handle iterators efficiently, ensuring that it performs well even for larger strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Knowledge Learned and How It Helps**:\n",
    "1. **Working with Strings and Iterators**: Understanding how to efficiently split, reverse, and join strings is a critical skill when working with text-based data.\n",
    "   - **In Interview**: The interviewer will appreciate the concise, efficient approach to solving string manipulation problems, showing both problem-solving ability and knowledge of Rust’s powerful iterator methods.\n",
    "2. **Space Efficiency**: By understanding space complexity in relation to how data is stored (e.g., splitting strings into a vector), you can optimize for memory usage in larger problems, especially with big data processing tasks.\n",
    "3. **Functional Programming in Rust**: By learning to use iterator-based functions, you can write cleaner, more modular code in Rust. This approach can be useful in real-world projects requiring transformations of collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Verdict**:\n",
    "This code is an excellent solution that showcases your ability to manipulate strings efficiently using Rust’s iterator tools. The time and space complexity are optimal for this problem, and it’s a perfect example of how to leverage functional programming techniques in Rust to produce clean, efficient solutions."
