    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "1. **String Concatenation and Comparison**:  \n",
    "   - The condition `str1 + str2 == str2 + str1` requires concatenating the strings and comparing them.  \n",
    "   - String concatenation takes \\(O(\\text{len1} + \\text{len2})\\), and comparison also takes \\(O(\\text{len1} + \\text{len2})\\).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GCD Calculation**:  \n",
    "   - The `gcd` function is based on the **Euclidean algorithm**, which runs in \\(O(\\log(\\min(\\text{len1}, \\text{len2})))\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Slicing the String**:  \n",
    "   - Extracting the substring `str1[0..length]` takes \\(O(\\text{length})\\), where `length` is the GCD of the two string lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Total Time Complexity**:  \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "1. **String Concatenation**: Temporary strings are created for `str1 + str2` and `str2 + str1`. This uses \\(O(\\text{len1} + \\text{len2})\\) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GCD Function**: The Euclidean algorithm uses \\(O(1)\\) space for calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Total Space Complexity**: \\(O(\\text{len1} + \\text{len2})\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### DSA Concepts Used\n",
    "1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:\n",
    "   - The core idea is to determine the length of the largest substring that divides both strings, which aligns with the mathematical GCD of the lengths of the strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **String Manipulation**:\n",
    "   - Operations like concatenation, comparison, and slicing are used to verify divisibility and extract the GCD substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Concepts Were Used\n",
    "1. **Euclidean Algorithm**: \n",
    "   - Efficiently finds the GCD of two numbers, which directly relates to finding the repeating pattern's length.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **String Concatenation Check**: \n",
    "   - Ensures that one string can actually be formed by repeating the other, as a mathematical GCD may not always correspond to a valid string.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When This Knowledge Is Useful\n",
    "1. **Pattern Analysis in Strings**:\n",
    "   - Identifying repeating patterns in strings, such as in DNA sequence analysis, cyclic data, or periodic signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Compression**:\n",
    "   - Finding the smallest repeating unit in data can help optimize storage by storing only the repeating unit and its count.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Substring Problems**:\n",
    "   - Determining common substrings or factors across datasets, such as shared prefixes in files or URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Algorithm Optimization**:\n",
    "   - Learning how to integrate mathematical concepts like GCD into string problems is valuable for solving problems that combine numerical and string-based logic efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **String Equivalence**:\n",
    "   - Use cases where you need to determine if two strings share a common repetitive structure, like validating configurations or file formats. \n",
    "\n",
