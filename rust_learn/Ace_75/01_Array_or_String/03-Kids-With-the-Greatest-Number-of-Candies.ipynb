    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finding the Maximum Candies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `candies.iter().max()` iterates through the entire list once to find the maximum value, which takes \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mapping Over the List**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `.map()` function iterates over the list once to check if each kid's candies plus the extra candies are greater than or equal to the maximum. This also takes \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Total Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporary Storage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The boolean results are stored in a new vector, which takes \\(O(n)\\) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterators**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Iterators are used for both `max()` and `.map()`, which require \\(O(1)\\) additional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Total Space Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), primarily for the output vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### DSA Concepts Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterators**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The solution uses iterators (`iter()`, `map()`, and `collect()`), which are powerful abstractions for working with collections in a concise and expressive manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comparison**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The logic involves comparing each value in the list to a precomputed maximum, a common operation in problems requiring condition-based filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Greedy Approach**:\n",
    "   - By finding the maximum value in advance, the solution efficiently determines whether a condition is met for each kid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Concepts Were Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Calculating the maximum candy count in advance reduces redundant operations. By precomputing the `most`, the solution avoids recalculating the maximum for each kid, making the approach linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplicity**:\n",
    "   - The use of iterators (`map()` and `collect()`) makes the code concise and readable. Rust's standard library functions handle most of the low-level logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When This Knowledge Is Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Condition-Based Evaluation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This approach is useful for problems where a precomputed value (like a maximum or minimum) is used to evaluate a condition across a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Threshold Problems**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In scenarios where you need to check if elements in a dataset meet a threshold condition, this technique can be applied (e.g., validating scores, budgets, or limits).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **One-Pass Operations**:\n",
    "   - Problems requiring a single scan or minimal overhead (like this one) can benefit from this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Code Is Suitable for This Question\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimal Performance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The solution leverages a single pass to find the maximum and another to determine which kids meet the condition, ensuring \\(O(n)\\) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clear Logic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The code directly reflects the problem statement:\n",
    "     - Compute the maximum candies.\n",
    "     - Check if each kid's candies + extra candies meet or exceed this maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rust-Specific Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The use of iterators (`iter()`, `map()`, and `collect()`) makes the code both idiomatic and efficient, demonstrating a strong understanding of Rust's standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handles Edge Cases**:\n",
    "   - The approach works well for small inputs (minimum 2 kids) and large inputs (up to 100 kids) within the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution demonstrates how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **iterators** to simplify and optimize problems involving collections.\n",
    "- Precompute key values (e.g., maximum or minimum) to reduce redundant calculations.\n",
    "- Apply a **greedy approach** to efficiently solve threshold or condition-based problems.\n"
