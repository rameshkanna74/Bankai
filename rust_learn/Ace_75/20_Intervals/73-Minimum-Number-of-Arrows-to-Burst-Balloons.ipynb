Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons\n","     Medium\n","     Topics\n","     Companies\n","\n","There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.\n","\n","Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.\n","\n","Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.\n","\n","Example 1:\n","\n","Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]\n","Output: 2\n","Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:\n","\n","- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].\n","- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].\n","\n","Example 2:\n","\n","Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]\n","Output: 4\n","Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.\n","\n","Example 3:\n","\n","Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]\n","Output: 2\n","Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:\n","\n","- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].\n","- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].\n","\n","Constraints:\n","\n","    1 <= points.length <= 105\n","    points[i].length == 2\n","    -231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1\n","\n","---\n","\n","give best time and space complexity code in rust,give variables usefull name, add comments to explain the code way more clear,also add code to run example case, use below typing\n","\n","---\n","\n","impl Solution {\n","pub fn find_min_arrow_shots(points: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> i32 {\n","\n","    }\n","\n","}\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
