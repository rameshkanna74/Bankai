Suggested products should have common prefix with searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.\n","\n","Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord is typed.\n","\n","Example 1:\n","\n","Input: products = [\"mobile\",\"mouse\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\",\"mousepad\"], searchWord = \"mouse\"\n","Output: [[\"mobile\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\"],[\"mobile\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\"],[\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"],[\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"],[\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"]]\n","Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = [\"mobile\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\",\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"].\n","After typing m and mo all products match and we show user [\"mobile\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\"].\n","After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests [\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"].\n","\n","Example 2:\n","\n","Input: products = [\"havana\"], searchWord = \"havana\"\n","Output: [[\"havana\"],[\"havana\"],[\"havana\"],[\"havana\"],[\"havana\"],[\"havana\"]]\n","Explanation: The only word \"havana\" will be always suggested while typing the search word.\n","\n","Constraints:\n","\n","    1 <= products.length <= 1000\n","    1 <= products[i].length <= 3000\n","    1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 104\n","    All the strings of products are unique.\n","    products[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\n","    1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000\n","    searchWord consists of lowercase English letters.\n","\n","---\n","\n","give best time and space complexity code in rust,give variables usefull name, add comments to explain the code way more clear,also add code to run example case, use below typing\n","\n","---\n","\n","impl Solution {\n","pub fn suggested_products(products: Vec<String>, search_word: String) -> Vec<Vec<String>> {\n","\n","    }\n","\n","}\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
