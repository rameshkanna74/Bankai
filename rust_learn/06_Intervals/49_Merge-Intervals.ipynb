    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their starting times. This is essential for merging because it allows us to only check the next interval against the current one.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Merging Logic**:\n",
    "   - We initialize a `current_interval` with the first interval from the sorted list.\n",
    "   - We iterate through the remaining intervals and check if the `current_interval` overlaps with each interval.\n",
    "   - If they overlap (i.e., if the end of `current_interval` is greater than or equal to the start of the next interval), we update the end of the `current_interval` to the maximum of the two end times.\n",
    "   - If they do not overlap, we push the `current_interval` to the result list and update `current_interval` to the next interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Addition**: After the loop, we need to make sure to add the last `current_interval` to the merged list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of intervals.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the merged intervals in the output."
