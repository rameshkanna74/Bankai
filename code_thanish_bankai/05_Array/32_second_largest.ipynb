    "To solve the problem of finding the second largest element in an array, we need to keep track of two variables as we iterate through the array: the largest element and the second largest element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: The solution has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array. We make a single pass over the array to determine both the largest and second largest elements.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are only using a fixed number of variables to track the largest and second largest elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterate through the array once.\n",
    "2. Maintain two variables:\n",
    "   - `largest` to store the largest element.\n",
    "   - `second_largest` to store the second largest element.\n",
    "3. For each element in the array:\n",
    "   - If it is greater than `largest`, update both `second_largest` and `largest`.\n",
    "   - If it is not greater than `largest` but greater than `second_largest`, update `second_largest`.\n",
    "4. If `second_largest` is not updated (i.e., no second largest exists), return `-1`.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`find_second_largest` function**:\n",
    "   - **Input**: A slice `&[i32]` representing the array of integers.\n",
    "   - **Output**: The second largest element in the array, or `-1` if no second largest element exists.\n",
    "   - **Step-by-Step**:\n",
    "     - We initialize two variables `largest` and `second_largest` to `i32::MIN`, which is the smallest possible value for an `i32`. This ensures that any valid element in the array will be greater than the initial values.\n",
    "     - We then loop through each element in the array:\n",
    "       - If the current number is greater than `largest`, we update `second_largest` to be the old value of `largest`, and then update `largest` to the current number.\n",
    "       - If the current number is not larger than `largest`, but it's larger than `second_largest` and not equal to `largest`, we update `second_largest`.\n",
    "     - After iterating over all elements, if `second_largest` remains unchanged (i.e., it is still `i32::MIN`), we return `-1` indicating that a second largest element doesn't exist.\n",
    "2. **`main` function**:\n",
    "   - This function demonstrates the use of `find_second_largest` with two example arrays:\n",
    "     - `arr1 = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]` where the second largest element is `34`.\n",
    "     - `arr2 = [10, 10]` where no second largest element exists, so the output is `-1`.\n",
    "   - The `println!` macro is used to print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Run Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "The second largest element in arr1 is: 34\n",
    "The second largest element in arr2 is: -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This solution handles cases where there are duplicate values (like in `arr2 = [10, 10]`), and it ensures that the second largest element is not equal to the largest.\n",
    "- The code uses the constant value `i32::MIN` to initialize `largest` and `second_largest`, which allows us to handle cases where all elements might be small positive integers.\n",
    "- This approach ensures we only scan through the array once, making it both time-efficient and space-efficient.\n",
