    "To solve the problem of rotating an array left by one position, we can approach it in an efficient manner with both **O(n)** time complexity and **O(1)** space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Understanding**:\n",
    "   - The task is to rotate the array left by one position. This means the first element of the array should move to the end of the array, and all other elements should shift one position to the left.\n",
    "2. **Time and Space Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array. We are performing a single traversal of the array.\n",
    "   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)**, since the operation only involves modifying the array in-place and does not require additional storage proportional to the size of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rotation of the Array**: To rotate the array left by one position:\n",
    "  1. Take the first element.\n",
    "  2. Shift all other elements to the left.\n",
    "  3. Insert the first element at the end.\n",
    "- **In-place Operations**:\n",
    "  - We can perform the rotation using a simple **in-place** technique by moving the first element to the last position and shifting the rest of the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn left_rotate_by_one(arr: &mut Vec<i32>) {\n",
    "    // Check if the array has only one or zero elements\n",
    "    if arr.len() <= 1 {\n",
    "        return;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Remove the first element and store it\n",
    "    let first_element = arr.remove(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Push the first element to the end of the array\n",
    "    arr.push(first_element);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Example 1\n",
    "    let mut arr1 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n",
    "    left_rotate_by_one(&mut arr1);\n",
    "    println!(\"Array after left rotation by one: {:?}\", arr1);  // Expected: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Example 2\n",
    "    let mut arr2 = vec![5, 7, 3, 2];\n",
    "    left_rotate_by_one(&mut arr2);\n",
    "    println!(\"Array after left rotation by one: {:?}\", arr2);  // Expected: [7, 3, 2, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Example 3\n",
    "    let mut arr3 = vec![4, 0, 3, 2, 5];\n",
    "    left_rotate_by_one(&mut arr3);\n",
    "    println!(\"Array after left rotation by one: {:?}\", arr3);  // Expected: [0, 3, 2, 5, 4]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`left_rotate_by_one` function**:\n",
    "   - **Input**: A mutable reference to a `Vec<i32>`, which represents the array to be rotated.\n",
    "   - **Output**: The same array after performing the left rotation by one position.\n",
    "   - **Steps**:\n",
    "     - We check if the array has one or zero elements. In such cases, no rotation is needed, so we simply return.\n",
    "     - We remove the first element of the array using `arr.remove(0)`, which shifts all elements to the left by one position.\n",
    "     - We then push the removed element to the end of the array using `arr.push(first_element)`.\n",
    "2. **`main` function**:\n",
    "   - We create three example arrays:\n",
    "     - `arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
    "     - `arr2 = [5, 7, 3, 2]`\n",
    "     - `arr3 = [4, 0, 3, 2, 5]`\n",
    "   - For each array, we call `left_rotate_by_one` to rotate it left by one position, and we print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Run Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Array after left rotation by one: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]\n",
    "Array after left rotation by one: [7, 3, 2, 5]\n",
    "Array after left rotation by one: [0, 3, 2, 5, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `arr.remove(0)` operation has a time complexity of **O(n)** since it shifts all remaining elements in the vector after the removal. This is the most efficient approach in terms of code simplicity, but it can be improved in terms of time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternate Optimized Solution Using Array Shifting:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're aiming for optimal time complexity and can avoid expensive operations like `remove(0)`, you can implement the shift manually. Here’s an optimized version that avoids using `remove()` and `push()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn left_rotate_by_one_optimized(arr: &mut Vec<i32>) {\n",
    "    // Check if the array has only one or zero elements\n",
    "    if arr.len() <= 1 {\n",
    "        return;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Perform the left rotation by moving the elements manually\n",
    "    let first_element = arr[0];\n",
    "    for i in 1..arr.len() {\n",
    "        arr[i - 1] = arr[i];\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    arr[arr.len() - 1] = first_element;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Example 1\n",
    "    let mut arr1 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n",
    "    left_rotate_by_one_optimized(&mut arr1);\n",
    "    println!(\"Optimized rotation: {:?}\", arr1);  // Expected: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Example 2\n",
    "    let mut arr2 = vec![5, 7, 3, 2];\n",
    "    left_rotate_by_one_optimized(&mut arr2);\n",
    "    println!(\"Optimized rotation: {:?}\", arr2);  // Expected: [7, 3, 2, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Example 3\n",
    "    let mut arr3 = vec![4, 0, 3, 2, 5];\n",
    "    left_rotate_by_one_optimized(&mut arr3);\n",
    "    println!(\"Optimized rotation: {:?}\", arr3);  // Expected: [0, 3, 2, 5, 4]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimized Approach Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manual Shifting**: Instead of using `remove(0)` and `push()`, we manually shift the elements in the array to the left by one position using a loop. The first element is then placed at the last position.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is still **O(n)**, but it avoids the overhead of `remove` and `push` operations, making it more efficient for larger arrays.\n",
