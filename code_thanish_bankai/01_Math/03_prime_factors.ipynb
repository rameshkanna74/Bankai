    "To solve the problem of finding the unique prime factors of a number `N`, we need to factorize `N` efficiently. The optimal approach is to use trial division up to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\), checking each number to see if it divides `N`. If it does, we continue dividing `N` by that number to ensure we only get unique prime factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Prime Factorization**: Any integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes. We want the **unique** prime factors of `N`.\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: By checking divisibility up to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\), we significantly reduce the number of checks we need to make compared to checking up to `N-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "1. Start by checking the smallest prime factor (i.e., `2`).\n",
    "2. Then check for all odd numbers starting from `3` up to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\).\n",
    "3. If a number divides `N`, we keep dividing `N` by that number to eliminate its multiples.\n",
    "4. If `N` is still greater than 1 after processing all numbers up to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\), `N` itself must be prime and should be included as a prime factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(\\sqrt{N}) \\) because we only check for factors up to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) and we use efficient division to eliminate non-prime factors.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(\\log N) \\) to store the list of prime factors (since there are at most \\( O(\\log N) \\) prime factors for a number `N`).\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling the Factor `2`**:\n",
    "   - We first check if `2` divides `N` (the smallest prime). If it does, we add `2` to the result list and continue dividing `N` by `2` until it's no longer divisible by `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Odd Factors**:\n",
    "   - We then check for odd numbers starting from `3` up to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\). For each divisor `i` that divides `N`, we keep dividing `N` by `i` until it's no longer divisible by `i`, ensuring that we only include unique prime factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remaining Prime**:\n",
    "   - After processing all possible factors up to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\), if `N` is still greater than 1, then `N` itself is prime and should be added to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Returning the Result**:\n",
    "   - The `prime_factors` vector holds all unique prime factors in increasing order, which is returned as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: N = 100\n",
    "Output: Prime factors of 100: [2, 5]\n",
    "Explanation: The prime factors of 100 are 2 and 5.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: N = 35\n",
    "Output: Prime factors of 35: [5, 7]\n",
    "Explanation: The prime factors of 35 are 5 and 7.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Test Case:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: N = 210\n",
    "Output: Prime factors of 210: [2, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "Explanation: The prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **O(\\(\\sqrt{N}\\))**: We only check divisibility for numbers up to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\), and we eliminate factors by dividing `N` multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **O(\\(\\log N\\))**: The number of unique prime factors of a number `N` is typically \\( O(\\log N) \\) because the prime factors grow exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is efficient for the given constraints, and the use of trial division up to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) ensures the program runs in a reasonable time for large values of `N`."
