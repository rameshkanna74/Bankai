    "To solve this problem of finding both the **LCM (Least Common Multiple)** and **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)** of two numbers efficiently, we'll use the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GCD**: As previously discussed, the **GCD** can be computed using the **Euclidean Algorithm**.\n",
    "2. **LCM**: The **LCM** of two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n",

    "- **GCD** can be computed using the Euclidean algorithm in \\( O(\\log(\\min(a, b))) \\) time.\n",
    "- **LCM** can be computed from the GCD in constant time after finding the GCD.\n",

    "### Plan:\n",
    "1. First, compute the **GCD** of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`gcd` Function**:\n",
    "   - This function uses the **Euclidean algorithm** to calculate the GCD of two numbers. It iteratively reduces the problem size by taking the remainder when dividing `x` by `y` and swapping the values until `y` becomes zero. The final value of `x` is the GCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`lcm_and_gcd` Function**:\n",
    "   - This function computes the **LCM** and **GCD** of two numbers `a` and `b`:\n",
    "     - First, it computes the **GCD** using the `gcd` function.\n",
    "     - Then, it computes the **LCM** using the formula:\n",
    "       \\[\n",
    "       \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)}\n",
    "       \\]\n",
    "     - Finally, it returns the **LCM** and **GCD** as a `Vec<i32>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Function**:\n",
    "   - The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `lcm_and_gcd` function by calling it with different inputs and printing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **GCD** computation using the Euclidean algorithm is \\( O(\\log(\\min(a, b))) \\).\n",
    "- **LCM** computation is done in constant time \\( O(1) \\) after the GCD is found.\n",
    "- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \\( O(\\log(\\min(a, b))) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- The space complexity is \\( O(1) \\), as we only use a constant amount of extra space (for storing intermediate values like `gcd_val` and `lcm_val`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the input `a = 5` and `b = 10`:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   LCM and GCD of 5 and 10 are: [10, 5]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the input `a = 14` and `b = 8`:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   LCM and GCD of 14 and 8 are: [56, 2]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the input `a = 1` and `b = 1`:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   LCM and GCD of 1 and 1 are: [1, 1]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints where \\( 1 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^9 \\)."
