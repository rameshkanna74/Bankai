    "To compute **nCr** (also known as the **binomial coefficient**), we need to use the following mathematical formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "nCr = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( n! \\) represents the factorial of \\( n \\)\n",
    "- \\( r! \\) represents the factorial of \\( r \\)\n",
    "- \\( (n - r)! \\) represents the factorial of \\( (n - r) \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "- If \\( r > n \\), then \\( nCr = 0 \\) by definition.\n",
    "- \\( nC0 = 1 \\) for any value of \\( n \\), by definition (since choosing 0 elements from \\( n \\) is always 1 way).\n",
    "- \\( nCr = nC(n - r) \\), so we can minimize the calculation by always computing \\( nCr \\) for the smaller of \\( r \\) and \\( (n - r) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization:\n",
    "- Instead of computing factorials directly (which can be large), we can compute **nCr** using a more efficient iterative approach. This avoids the overhead of calculating large factorials and minimizes the number of multiplications.\n",

    "### Approach:\n",
    "1. **Base cases**: If \\( r > n \\), return 0. If \\( r = 0 \\) or \\( r = n \\), return 1.\n",
    "2. **Iterative approach**: Compute **nCr** as:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   nCr = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{n - (r - i)}{i}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   This formula works because of how the factorials cancel out during the division, which makes the computation efficient.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edge Cases**:\n",
    "   - If \\( r > n \\), return 0.\n",
    "   - If \\( r = 0 \\) or \\( r = n \\), return 1, since these are trivial cases by definition.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Optimizing Calculation**:\n",
    "   - We choose the smaller value between \\( r \\) and \\( (n - r) \\). This minimizes the number of multiplications we need to perform, as the smaller \\( r \\) results in fewer iterations in the loop.\n",
    "   - The formula is applied iteratively, avoiding the need to compute large factorials directly. For each \\( i \\) from 1 to \\( r \\), we multiply the result by \\( \\frac{n - (r - i)}{i} \\). This is an optimized form of the binomial coefficient formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Instead of computing factorials, the loop iterates from 1 to \\( r \\), multiplying the result by the terms from the formula. This results in fewer intermediate values and avoids integer overflow in intermediate computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(r) \\), where \\( r \\) is the smaller of \\( r \\) and \\( (n - r) \\). This is because we loop \\( r \\) times to compute the result.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(1) \\), as we only use a constant amount of space for intermediate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example 1**:\n",
    "   - Input: `n = 3`, `r = 2`\n",
    "   - Output: `3` (since \\( 3C2 = 3 \\))\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example 2**:\n",
    "   - Input: `n = 2`, `r = 4`\n",
    "   - Output: `0` (since \\( r > n \\), so no solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example 3**:\n",
    "   - Input: `n = 5`, `r = 0`\n",
    "   - Output: `1` (since \\( 5C0 = 1 \\))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Test Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Case 1**:\n",
    "  - Input: `n = 6`, `r = 3`\n",
    "  - Output: `20` (since \\( 6C3 = 20 \\))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Case 2**:\n",
    "  - Input: `n = 10`, `r = 5`\n",
    "  - Output: `252` (since \\( 10C5 = 252 \\))\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient and works within the problem's constraints. It avoids the computational overhead of calculating large factorials directly and ensures that even large inputs are handled efficiently."
