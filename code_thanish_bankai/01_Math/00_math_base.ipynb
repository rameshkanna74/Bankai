    "\n",
    "The `%` operator is used to find the **remainder** of the division of two numbers. When you divide two numbers, the `%` operator gives the remainder after the division.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "remainder = a % b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `a` is the dividend (the number being divided).\n",
    "- `b` is the divisor (the number by which you are dividing `a`).\n",
    "- The result of `a % b` is the remainder of the division.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1: Basic Modulo Operation\n",
    "print(10 % 3)  # Output: 1 (10 divided by 3 gives remainder 1)\n",

    "Great question! The behavior of the **modulo operator** (`%`) with negative numbers can be a bit tricky. Let's break it down in detail to understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Concept of Modulo\n",
    "\n",
    "The **modulo operation** finds the **remainder** when dividing one number by another. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `10 % 3 = 1`, because 10 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 1 (10 = 3 \\* 3 + 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when you have **negative numbers** involved in the operation, the result changes slightly due to how Python (and most programming languages) define the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rule for Modulo with Negative Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the modulo operation in Python ensures that the **remainder** (the result of `a % b`) always has the **same sign** as the divisor `b`, **not** the dividend `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The remainder (`a % b`) must always be non-negative if `b` is positive.\n",
    "- If `b` is negative, the remainder will be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How `-10 % 3` Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down `-10 % 3`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1**: Divide `-10` by `3`:\n",
    "   - The result is `-3.333...`. When you floor the result (round down), the quotient is `-4`.\n",
    "2. **Step 2**: Multiply the quotient by the divisor (`-4 * 3 = -12`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step 3**: Subtract the result from the dividend (`-10 - (-12) = 2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the **remainder** when dividing `-10` by `3` is **2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why 2 and Not -1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python ensures that the result of the modulo operation is **always non-negative** when the divisor is positive. Here's how Python handles the modulo calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `-10 % 3`, the division is `-10 / 3 = -3.333...`. The **quotient** is `-4` (rounded down), and the corresponding **remainder** is `2` because:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  -10 = (-4) \\* 3 + 2\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  So, the remainder is **2**, which is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is consistent with the rule that the remainder must have the same sign as the divisor, which is **positive** in this case (`3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does This Compare to Other Languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-10 % 3 = 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "In some other languages (like C, Java, or JavaScript), the modulo of a negative number might result in a negative remainder. However, in Python, the remainder is adjusted to always have the same sign as the divisor.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
