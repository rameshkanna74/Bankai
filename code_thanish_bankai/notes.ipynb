    "### Memory Size of a Boolean:\n",
    "The **size** of a `bool` in Rust is **not guaranteed to be exactly one byte**. While the **Rust documentation** and many other programming languages typically represent a boolean as 1 byte (since that's the smallest unit of memory that can hold two distinct values), Rust's `bool` type **does not have a fixed memory size of exactly 1 byte**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "- **On most systems**, a boolean (`bool`) in Rust is typically **1 byte** (or 8 bits) due to the way memory is allocated for data types and how `true` and `false` are stored.\n",
    "- However, **Rust does not guarantee** that a `bool` will always take exactly 1 byte. The compiler can optimize and use a different representation if needed, especially when booleans are part of a struct or an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Detailed Memory Representation:\n",
    "- **Memory efficiency**: Rust tries to optimize memory usage. When booleans are stored in collections (like arrays or vectors), Rust can pack multiple boolean values into a single byte, especially when using the `bitflags` crate or similar structures.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example of packing booleans:\n",
    "  ```rust\n",
    "  use std::mem;\n",
    "\n",
    "  fn main() {\n",
    "      let arr = [true, false, true, true]; // Array of booleans\n",
    "      println!(\"Size of bool: {}\", mem::size_of::<bool>()); // Prints the size of bool\n",
    "      println!(\"Size of array: {}\", mem::size_of_val(&arr)); // Size of the array\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - The `mem::size_of::<bool>()` will typically print `1` byte (on most systems).\n",
    "  - The size of an array of booleans depends on how Rust stores and aligns them in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Answer:\n",
    "- The **type** is `bool`, and you can define it with values `true` or `false`.\n",
    "- In **most cases**, it occupies **1 byte** of memory, but the size is not strictly guaranteed by the Rust specification.\n",
    "- Rust is designed to be memory-efficient, so the actual memory usage may vary depending on the context (like when booleans are part of larger structures or collections)."

    "### Rust's `char` Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Rust, the `char` type represents a **Unicode Scalar Value**.\n",
    "- **Unicode Scalar Values** are all the valid code points in Unicode, except for the **surrogate code points** (which are reserved for UTF-16 encoding and not valid in UTF-32).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Size of `char`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `char` in Rust is **4 bytes** (32 bits) in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because Rust's `char` type is implemented as a **Unicode Scalar Value**, which corresponds to a 32-bit code point in the Unicode standard. Since Unicode assigns code points using 32 bits, Rust uses 4 bytes to store a `char`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unicode Scalar Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unicode Scalar Values can represent a much wider range of characters than just ASCII.\n",
    "  - **ASCII** (which is a subset of Unicode) can represent 128 characters (from 0 to 127), such as basic Latin letters, digits, and punctuation.\n",
    "  - **Unicode** includes a far broader range, with over 1.1 million possible code points, including characters from almost every language in the world, emojis, and special symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `char` in Rust can store **any valid Unicode character**, including those from languages like Chinese, Arabic, or Greek, as well as emojis and other symbols.\n",
    "- Rust's `char` type is capable of handling characters that are **outside the ASCII range**, unlike some other languages where `char` might be limited to 1 byte or 2 bytes (for UTF-16 in Java, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let ascii_char: char = 'A';  // ASCII character\n",
    "    let unicode_char: char = '😊';  // Unicode character (Emoji)\n",
    "    let japanese_char: char = '日'; // Japanese character\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"ASCII Char: {}\", ascii_char);      // Output: A\n",
    "    println!(\"Unicode Char: {}\", unicode_char);  // Output: 😊\n",
    "    println!(\"Japanese Char: {}\", japanese_char); // Output: 日\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`char` in Rust** is 4 bytes (32 bits), which allows it to store any Unicode Scalar Value.\n",
    "2. It can represent characters beyond the basic ASCII set, such as characters from different scripts (e.g., Greek, Cyrillic, Chinese) and **emojis**.\n",
    "3. **Rust's `char`** is **not the same as a string**; it represents a single Unicode character, whereas a **string** (`String` or `&str`) in Rust is a collection of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASCII vs Unicode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ASCII** is a 7-bit encoding scheme that represents 128 characters (from 0 to 127).\n",
    "- **Unicode** is a much broader character encoding standard, capable of representing over 1.1 million characters, which includes all characters from ASCII plus additional characters from almost every writing system in use today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust's `char` type is **4 bytes** and can represent any Unicode Scalar Value, which includes a vast range of characters beyond just the ASCII set. This allows Rust to support a wide variety of languages and symbols while still using a fixed-size type for individual characters.\n"

    "A **tuple without any value** in Rust is called an **empty tuple**, and it is represented by **`()`,** often referred to as the **unit type**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points about the Unit Type `()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **unit type** `()` is a type that has exactly **one possible value**: `()`.\n",
    "- It is used to signify **absence of a value** or **nothingness** in Rust.\n",
    "- It is most commonly used when a function doesn't return any meaningful value, or when an expression or function call doesn't need to return any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Does the Empty Tuple (Unit Type) `()` Appear?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In Function Signatures Without a Return Value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If a function doesn't return anything meaningful (i.e., it returns \"nothing\"), its return type is `()`. This is akin to `void` in other languages like C, C++, or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   fn do_nothing() -> () {\n",
    "       println!(\"This function does nothing and returns the unit type.\");\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the function `do_nothing()` doesn't return any value, and its return type is explicitly `()`. In Rust, if a function has no return statement, it implicitly returns `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For Expressions That Result in No Value (Implicit Return):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In cases where you don't explicitly return a value from a function, Rust will automatically return the unit type `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   fn main() {\n",
    "       let result = do_nothing(); // `do_nothing` implicitly returns `()`\n",
    "       println!(\"The result is {:?}\", result); // Prints: The result is ()\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   fn do_nothing() {\n",
    "       // No explicit return, so returns `()` by default\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The unit type `()` can be used in pattern matching, typically when you expect a function or value to have no meaningful return.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   fn main() {\n",
    "       let value = ();\n",
    "\n",
    "       match value {\n",
    "           () => println!(\"It's the unit type!\"), // Unit type matches here\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **In the Context of a Function's Return Type for Side Effects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - When functions perform actions (like printing to the console, modifying state, etc.) without returning any value, they return `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   fn print_message() {\n",
    "       println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `print_message` function doesn't return anything, so its return type is implicitly `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is `()` Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indicating Absence of a Value**: It is used when a function or expression is meant to signal that there is no meaningful result. For example, you might write a function that performs some action (like logging, updating state, or performing a side effect) without returning any data.\n",
    "- **Type Consistency**: Rust requires that every function has an explicit return type. When you don't have a return value, the unit type `()` is used to fulfill this requirement.\n",
    "- **Implicit Use**: Often, `()` is not explicitly written in function signatures because it is the default return type for functions that don't return anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Using Unit Type in Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Returning `()` from a function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   fn main() {\n",
    "       let result = print_message();\n",
    "       println!(\"The result of calling print_message is: {:?}\", result); // Prints: The result of calling print_message is: ()\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   fn print_message() -> () {\n",
    "       println!(\"This function doesn't return anything.\");\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `()` in Function Calls with No Return Value**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   fn main() {\n",
    "       let _ = do_nothing(); // The return value is `()`, which is ignored\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   fn do_nothing() -> () {\n",
    "       println!(\"I do nothing and return the unit type.\");\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **unit type** `()` is a tuple that has no values and is used to represent **absence of a value**.\n",
    "- It is commonly used for functions that don't return any meaningful data or when a value is expected, but there's none to provide (like side effects or logging).\n",
    "- The unit type is essential for **functions with no return value**, and it implicitly returns when no explicit return statement is provided.\n"

    "In Rust, there are several ways to create and initialize arrays. Here’s a breakdown of the different approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Literal Initialization** (specifying elements directly)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common way to create an array by explicitly listing the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  // A 5-element array of integers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `arr` is a fixed-size array with elements `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Using the `[value; size]` Syntax** (initialize with repeated values)\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax creates an array with a specified size where all elements are initialized to the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let arr = [0; 10];  // A 10-element array, all elements initialized to 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `arr` is an array of 10 elements, all set to `0`. The syntax `[value; size]` is a concise way to create an array with identical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Using the `vec!` Macro (for creating a `Vec` instead of an array)**\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is not strictly an array (since `Vec` is a dynamic collection), it’s common to use it when you need a dynamically-sized array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  // A `Vec` (dynamically sized) with 5 elements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a `Vec<i32>`, a heap-allocated collection, instead of a fixed-size array. `Vec` can grow or shrink during runtime, making it more flexible than arrays. While not technically an array, `Vec` is often used when the size of the collection is not known ahead of time or may change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Using the `array::from_fn` Function (Rust 1.64+)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows you to generate an array where each element is computed using a closure. This is useful for creating arrays where each element depends on the index or some other computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let arr: [i32; 5] = array::from_fn(|i| i as i32 * 2);  // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `array::from_fn` creates an array of size `5`, where each element is computed by doubling its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Using `Default::default()` for Default Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can initialize an array with the default value for its type using the `Default::default()` trait. This is mostly used for types that implement `Default`, such as integers (which default to `0`), `bool` (which defaults to `false`), and other types that implement the `Default` trait.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let arr: [i32; 10] = Default::default();  // A 10-element array of `0`s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a 10-element array of `i32` with all elements set to `0`. This is a more generic way to initialize an array of a specific size with default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Using `std::array::from_iter` (for converting an iterator to an array)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `from_iter` function allows you to convert an iterator (such as one from a range or any collection) directly into an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let arr: [i32; 5] = std::array::from_iter(0..5).collect::<Vec<_>>().try_into().unwrap();\n",

    "### Summary of Array Creation Methods in Rust:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Literal Initialization**: `[1, 2, 3]` — Directly specifying the elements.\n",
    "2. **Repeated Value Initialization**: `[value; size]` — Creating an array with repeated values.\n",
    "3. **Using `vec!`**: Creates a `Vec` (dynamically-sized array) instead of a fixed-size array.\n",
    "4. **`array::from_fn`**: Generate an array using a closure for element computation (Rust 1.64+).\n",
    "5. **Using `Default::default()`**: Initialize all elements with the default value for the type.\n",
    "6. **Using `std::array::from_iter()`**: Convert an iterator into a fixed-size array (requires careful handling).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods has specific use cases, and the choice depends on your needs, such as whether the size is fixed or dynamic, or whether you want to use computed values or default initialization.\n"

    "In Rust, the distinction between **statements** and **expressions** is fundamental to how the language is structured and how control flow and value computation work. Here's a breakdown of the differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Statements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statement** is a line of code that performs an action but **does not return a value**. In Rust, statements are used to execute code but do not yield a result that can be used further in an expression or assigned to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Executes some side effect, like calling a function or performing an assignment.\n",
    "  - Does **not** return a value that can be used in further expressions.\n",
    "  - Can be thought of as \"imperative\" instructions to the program.\n",
    "  - **End with a semicolon (`;`)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```rust\n",
    "  let x = 5;  // This is an assignment statement.\n",
    "  println!(\"Hello, world!\");  // This is a function call statement.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  In both examples, no value is returned; they just cause an action to happen (variable assignment and printing output, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Expressions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "An **expression** is a part of the code that **evaluates to a value**. It produces a result, and this result can be used in further expressions, assigned to variables, or returned from a function. Expressions are the fundamental building blocks of Rust's \"expression-based\" language design.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Evaluates to a value.\n",
    "  - Can be used to produce new values, passed to functions, or assigned to variables.\n",
    "  - **Does not require a semicolon** (unless it is followed by a statement).\n",
    "  - Can have side effects (e.g., function calls) but are primarily about producing a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```rust\n",
    "  let y = 3 + 4;  // The expression `3 + 4` evaluates to the value `7`.\n",
    "  let z = if x > 0 { \"positive\" } else { \"negative\" };  // The `if` expression evaluates to a value.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  In these examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `3 + 4` is an expression that evaluates to `7`.\n",
    "  - The `if` expression evaluates to either `\"positive\"` or `\"negative\"` depending on the value of `x`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Special Case: **The Last Expression in a Function**:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
