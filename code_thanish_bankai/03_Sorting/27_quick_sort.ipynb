    "### Quick Sort in Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Sort** is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. The main idea is to partition the array into two sub-arrays, sort those sub-arrays recursively, and then combine the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Divide and Conquer**: It picks a pivot element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.\n",
    "- **Recursion**: After partitioning, it recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n",
    "- **Pivot Selection**: The choice of pivot greatly influences the performance of the algorithm. Common strategies are selecting the first element, last element, random element, or the median element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best case**: O(n log n) when the pivot divides the array evenly.\n",
    "- **Worst case**: O(n²) when the pivot divides the array into very uneven partitions (e.g., already sorted data).\n",
    "- **Average case**: O(n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(log n)** due to recursion stack space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation for Quick Sort:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`quick_sort` function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This is the main function that implements the quicksort algorithm. It recursively calls itself to sort the array. The function takes the mutable reference of the array and the `low` and `high` indices that define the range to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`partition` function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `partition` function is responsible for selecting a pivot and rearranging the elements in such a way that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left side, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right.\n",
    "   - The function returns the index of the pivot element after the rearrangement, which helps in dividing the array into two parts for further sorting.\n",
    "   - We select the **rightmost element** as the pivot for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`main` function**:\n",
    "   - This initializes an array, prints the original array, calls the `quick_sort` function to sort the array, and then prints the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through an example for the array `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First call to `quick_sort`**:\n",
    "   - The array is `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`, and the pivot chosen is `5` (rightmost element).\n",
    "   - After partitioning, the array becomes `[1, 5, 8, 9, 7, 10]`, and the pivot `5` is placed in the correct position at index `1`.\n",
    "2. **Recursive calls**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We now recursively sort the sub-arrays:\n",
    "     - For the left sub-array `[1]`, no sorting is required (base case).\n",
    "     - For the right sub-array `[8, 9, 7, 10]`, the pivot is `10`, and after partitioning, the array becomes `[1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. The pivot `10` is placed in the correct position at index `5`.\n",
    "     - We recursively sort the left sub-array `[7, 8, 9]` and find the correct positions for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Sorted Array**:\n",
    "   - After all recursive calls, the sorted array is `[1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Original array: [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]\n",
    "Sorted array: [1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quick Sort** is a very efficient sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n). However, it can degrade to O(n²) if the pivot selection is not optimal (e.g., when the input is already sorted).\n",
    "- This implementation uses the **rightmost element** as the pivot. Other pivot selection strategies can be used to improve performance in certain scenarios (e.g., random pivot, median-of-three).\n",
    "- In the worst case (for highly unbalanced data), the algorithm can be slower than other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Heap Sort, but in practice, it performs very well.\n"

    "The Rust code you posted is an implementation of the **Quick Sort** algorithm, and it looks mostly correct. However, there are a couple of issues that could be fixed or clarified:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edge Case for `pivot > 0` in `quick_sort`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In the current code, the check `if pivot > 0` could result in a mistake. This should not be needed because `pivot` is the index of the partition, and it can be zero or a positive index. The check for `pivot > 0` is unnecessary and could skip some valid recursive calls for the left part of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The `partition` function**:\n",
    "   - The partition function works well to divide the array into two parts based on the pivot, but be mindful of how indices are handled. The way the `i` variable is used is correct but could be more intuitive with comments for clarity.\n",

    "### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`quick_sort` function**: This is the main recursive function. It keeps dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays and sorting them. It stops when the array size is reduced to 1 or fewer elements (`low >= high`).\n",
    "2. **`partition` function**: This is the key part of the Quick Sort algorithm. It takes the last element (`pivot`) and moves all smaller elements to its left and larger elements to its right. It then places the pivot in the correct sorted position and returns its index.\n",
    "3. **Recursive Calls**: The left and right parts of the array are recursively sorted by passing updated `low` and `high` values based on the position of the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the input array `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`, the output would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Original array: [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]\n",
    "Sorted array: [1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Array**: `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`\n",
    "2. **First Partition**: The pivot `5` is placed in its correct position at index `1`. The array becomes `[1, 5, 8, 9, 7, 10]`.\n",
    "3. **Recursively Sorting**:\n",
    "   - **Left of pivot**: The sub-array `[1]` is already sorted.\n",
    "   - **Right of pivot**: The sub-array `[8, 9, 7, 10]` is partitioned again with `10` as the pivot, and so on.\n",
    "4. After all recursive calls are completed, the final sorted array is `[1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Case**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "- **Worst Case**: O(n²), which happens when the pivot is chosen poorly (for example, when the array is already sorted).\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation works well for smaller arrays, but for very large datasets, alternative pivot selection methods (like random pivot or median-of-three) can be used to optimize the performance.\n"
