    "### Counting Sort in Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counting Sort** is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It is efficient when the range of numbers (keys) is known and not very large. Instead of comparing elements like in other sorting algorithms (e.g., QuickSort or MergeSort), it counts the occurrences of each distinct element in the array, then computes the position of each element in the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best, Worst, and Average Case**: O(n + k), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array and `k` is the range of the input (the difference between the maximum and minimum values).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(k), for storing the frequency of each distinct element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting sort works well when the range of the input is limited (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values is not very large).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count the frequency of each element in the input array.\n",
    "2. Compute the prefix sum (running total) of the counts to determine the correct position of each element.\n",
    "3. Place the elements into the output array based on their positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation for Counting Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn counting_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>) {\n",
    "    if arr.is_empty() {\n",
    "        return;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Step 1: Find the maximum and minimum values in the array\n",
    "    let max_val = *arr.iter().max().unwrap();\n",
    "    let min_val = *arr.iter().min().unwrap();\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Step 2: Create a counting array for frequencies\n",
    "    let range = (max_val - min_val + 1) as usize;\n",
    "    let mut count = vec![0; range]; // Array to store the frequency of each element\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Step 3: Count the frequency of each element in the original array\n",
    "    for &num in arr.iter() {\n",
    "        count[(num - min_val) as usize] += 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Step 4: Modify the count array to store the cumulative counts (prefix sum)\n",
    "    for i in 1..range {\n",
    "        count[i] += count[i - 1];\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Step 5: Build the output array by placing elements in their correct position\n",
    "    let mut output = vec![0; arr.len()];\n",
    "    for &num in arr.iter().rev() { // Traverse the input array in reverse order\n",
    "        let idx = (num - min_val) as usize;\n",
    "        output[count[idx] as usize - 1] = num;\n",
    "        count[idx] -= 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Step 6: Copy the sorted output back into the original array\n",
    "    arr.copy_from_slice(&output);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let mut arr = vec![4, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1, 5, 4];\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"Original array: {:?}\", arr);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Sorting the array using counting sort\n",
    "    counting_sort(&mut arr);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Output the sorted array\n",
    "    println!(\"Sorted array: {:?}\", arr);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finding Max and Min Values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `let max_val = *arr.iter().max().unwrap();` — We find the maximum element in the array.\n",
    "   - `let min_val = *arr.iter().min().unwrap();` — We find the minimum element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Count Array**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We create an array `count` of size equal to the range of numbers (`max_val - min_val + 1`).\n",
    "   - This array stores the frequency of each number.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Count Frequencies**:\n",
    "   - We iterate over the input array and increment the count of each number in the count array. We use `(num - min_val)` to map each element to an index in the count array.\n",
    "4. **Compute Cumulative Counts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We compute the prefix sum (cumulative count) of the `count` array so that each position in the `count` array tells us how many numbers are less than or equal to the current number.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Place Elements in Sorted Order**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We iterate over the original array (in reverse order) and place each element in its correct position in the output array. This is done by using the cumulative count to find the correct position and decrementing the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Copy Sorted Elements**:\n",
    "   - Finally, we copy the sorted elements from the `output` array back into the original `arr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input array `[4, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1, 5, 4]`, the steps of Counting Sort will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Max and Min Values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `max_val = 8`, `min_val = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Count Array**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The frequency array `count` will store the frequency of each number within the range [1, 8]:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     count = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This means:\n",
    "     - `1` appears 1 time.\n",
    "     - `2` appears 2 times.\n",
    "     - `3` appears 2 times.\n",
    "     - `4` appears 2 times.\n",
    "     - `5` appears 1 time.\n",
    "     - `8` appears 1 time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cumulative Count (Prefix Sum)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After calculating the prefix sum:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     count = [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Now, `count[i]` tells us how many numbers are smaller than or equal to `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Building the Output Array**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We iterate over the original array from the end and place each number in its correct position:\n",
    "     - For `4`, we place it at `count[4] - 1 = 6`.\n",
    "     - For `2`, we place it at `count[2] - 1 = 2`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Sorted Array**:\n",
    "   - The sorted array will be `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Original array: [4, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1, 5, 4]\n",
    "Sorted array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting Sort is a very efficient algorithm when the range of input elements is small. However, its effectiveness decreases when the range of values (`k`) is large compared to the number of elements (`n`). The algorithm is widely used in scenarios where the data fits into the required conditions, such as sorting integers in a constrained range or when negative numbers are not involved.\n"
