    "### Insertion Sort in Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion Sort is another simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the input into a sorted and an unsorted portion. The algorithm takes elements from the unsorted portion and inserts them into the correct position in the sorted portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worst and Average Case**: O(n²), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. In the worst case, when the array is sorted in reverse order, the algorithm performs `n*(n-1)/2` comparisons.\n",
    "- **Best Case**: O(n) when the array is already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(1)** because insertion sort is an **in-place** sorting algorithm.\n",

    "        let mut j = i as isize - 1;  // The index of the last element in the sorted part\n",
    "\n",

    "}\n",

    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `insertion_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>)`: This function takes a mutable reference to a vector of integers (`arr`) and sorts it in-place using insertion sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outer Loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `for i in 1..n`: The outer loop starts from the second element (index `1`) and goes through the entire array. The idea is that elements before `i` are already sorted, and we are looking to insert the `i`-th element into the sorted portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Element**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `let mut key = arr[i]`: The key element is the element at index `i`, which needs to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inner Loop (Shifting Elements)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `let mut j = i as isize - 1`: The index `j` starts at the last element of the sorted portion, which is at index `i - 1`.\n",
    "   - The inner loop checks if the element at position `j` is greater than the key. If it is, the element at `j` is shifted one position to the right, making space for the key.\n",
    "   - `arr[(j + 1) as usize] = arr[j as usize]`: Shift the element from the sorted portion to the right to create space for the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inserting the Key**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `arr[(j + 1) as usize] = key`: After the inner loop completes, the correct position for the key has been found, and the key is inserted there.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Main Function**:\n",
    "   - The `main` function initializes a vector, prints the original array, calls the `insertion_sort` function to sort it, and prints the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input array `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11]`, the insertion sort will work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Pass (i = 1)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `key = 34`, `arr[0] = 64` → 64 is greater than 34, so we shift 64 to the right.\n",
    "   - After shifting: `[64, 64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`\n",
    "   - Insert 34 at position 0 → `[34, 64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Pass (i = 2)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `key = 25`, `arr[1] = 64` → 64 is greater than 25, so we shift 64 to the right.\n",
    "   - After shifting: `[34, 64, 64, 12, 22, 11]`\n",
    "   - `arr[0] = 34` → 34 is greater than 25, so we shift 34 to the right.\n",
    "   - After shifting: `[34, 34, 64, 12, 22, 11]`\n",
    "   - Insert 25 at position 0 → `[25, 34, 64, 12, 22, 11]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third Pass (i = 3)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `key = 12`, `arr[2] = 64` → 64 is greater than 12, so we shift 64 to the right.\n",
    "   - After shifting: `[25, 34, 64, 64, 22, 11]`\n",
    "   - `arr[1] = 34` → 34 is greater than 12, so we shift 34 to the right.\n",
    "   - After shifting: `[25, 34, 34, 64, 22, 11]`\n",
    "   - `arr[0] = 25` → 25 is greater than 12, so we shift 25 to the right.\n",
    "   - After shifting: `[25, 25, 34, 64, 22, 11]`\n",
    "   - Insert 12 at position 0 → `[12, 25, 34, 64, 22, 11]`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Subsequent Passes**:\n",
    "   - The same process continues for the remaining elements. The elements are inserted into their correct positions in the sorted portion of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n",
    "Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion sort is a simple, intuitive sorting algorithm that is efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted data. However, its time complexity of **O(n²)** makes it inefficient for large datasets. In Rust, the algorithm is implemented concisely and efficiently using a mutable vector and basic loops.\n"
