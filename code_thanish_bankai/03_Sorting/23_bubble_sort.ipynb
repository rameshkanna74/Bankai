    "### Bubble Sort in Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top (or beginning) of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worst, Best, and Average Case**: O(n²), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. In the worst case, the algorithm performs `n*(n-1)/2` comparisons.\n",
    "- **Best Case**: O(n) when the list is already sorted, and we perform no swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(1)** because bubble sort is an **in-place** sorting algorithm.\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `bubble_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>)`: This function takes a mutable reference to a vector of integers (`arr`) and sorts it in-place using bubble sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outer Loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `for i in 0..n`: The outer loop iterates over the entire array. It performs at most `n` passes through the array. Each pass \"bubbles\" the largest unsorted element to the correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inner Loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `for j in 0..n - 1 - i`: The inner loop iterates through the array from the beginning, comparing each adjacent pair of elements. The value `n - 1 - i` ensures that the last `i` elements are already sorted and do not need to be checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Swapping Elements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]`: If the current element `arr[j]` is greater than the next element `arr[j + 1]`, they are swapped.\n",
    "   - `arr.swap(j, j + 1)`: This swaps the elements at indices `j` and `j + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Early Termination**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `swapped` flag tracks whether any elements were swapped during a pass.\n",
    "   - If no elements were swapped during a full pass (`swapped == false`), it means the array is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early to save unnecessary passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Main Function**:\n",
    "   - The `main` function initializes an array, prints the original array, calls the `bubble_sort` function to sort it, and then prints the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input array `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11]`, the bubble sort will work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Pass**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Compare `64` and `34` → swap → `[34, 64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`\n",
    "   - Compare `64` and `25` → swap → `[34, 25, 64, 12, 22, 11]`\n",
    "   - Compare `64` and `12` → swap → `[34, 25, 12, 64, 22, 11]`\n",
    "   - Compare `64` and `22` → swap → `[34, 25, 12, 22, 64, 11]`\n",
    "   - Compare `64` and `11` → swap → `[34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64]`\n",
    "\n",
    "   After the first pass, `64` is in its correct position at the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Pass**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Compare `34` and `25` → swap → `[25, 34, 12, 22, 11, 64]`\n",
    "   - Compare `34` and `12` → swap → `[25, 12, 34, 22, 11, 64]`\n",
    "   - Compare `34` and `22` → swap → `[25, 12, 22, 34, 11, 64]`\n",
    "   - Compare `34` and `11` → swap → `[25, 12, 22, 11, 34, 64]`\n",
    "\n",
    "   After the second pass, `34` is in its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third Pass**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Compare `25` and `12` → swap → `[12, 25, 22, 11, 34, 64]`\n",
    "   - Compare `25` and `22` → swap → `[12, 22, 25, 11, 34, 64]`\n",
    "   - Compare `25` and `11` → swap → `[12, 22, 11, 25, 34, 64]`\n",
    "\n",
    "   After the third pass, `25` is in its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fourth Pass**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Compare `12` and `22` → no swap.\n",
    "   - Compare `22` and `11` → swap → `[12, 11, 22, 25, 34, 64]`\n",
    "\n",
    "   After the fourth pass, `22` is in its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fifth Pass**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Compare `12` and `11` → swap → `[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64]`\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now the array is fully sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n",
    "Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble sort is a simple and easy-to-understand sorting algorithm, but due to its **O(n²)** time complexity, it is inefficient for large datasets. Nonetheless, it can be useful in educational settings to illustrate sorting and algorithmic concepts. In Rust, we can implement bubble sort efficiently and in a concise manner with the help of the `Vec` type and `swap` method.\n"
