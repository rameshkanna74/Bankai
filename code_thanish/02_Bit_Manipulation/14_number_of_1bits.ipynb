    "To solve the problem of counting the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of a positive integer `n`, we can use a bit manipulation technique. This approach works efficiently with a time complexity of \\(O(\\log n)\\), which is optimal for this problem. Here's how we can solve it in Rust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following approach to count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of the number `n`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Right-shift approach**: In each iteration, we check the least significant bit (LSB) of the number. If it is set (i.e., `1`), we increment the count. Then, we right-shift the number to check the next bit.\n",
    "2. **Condition**: We continue the process until the number becomes zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach works by continuously checking the LSB and discarding it until all bits have been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a counter initialized to 0.\n",
    "2. Check the least significant bit of `n` by performing `n & 1` (this checks if the LSB is `1`).\n",
    "3. Right-shift the number (`n >>= 1`) to discard the checked bit.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2-3 until `n` becomes 0.\n",
    "5. Return the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(\\log n)\\) because the number of iterations is proportional to the number of bits in `n`, which is \\(O(\\log n)\\).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\), as we only use a constant amount of extra space (for the counter).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn hammingWeight(n: u32) -> i32 {\n",

    "\n",
    "        // Loop until num becomes 0\n",
    "        while num > 0 {\n",
    "            // If the least significant bit is 1, increment the count\n",
    "            if num & 1 == 1 {\n",
    "                count += 1;\n",

    "\n",
    "        // Return the count of set bits\n",

    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let n1 = 6; // Binary: 110 -> Set bits: 2\n",
    "    let n2 = 8; // Binary: 1000 -> Set bits: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"Number of 1 bits in {}: {}\", n1, Solution::hammingWeight(n1)); // Output: 2\n",
    "    println!(\"Number of 1 bits in {}: {}\", n2, Solution::hammingWeight(n2)); // Output: 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**: The function `hammingWeight` takes a `u32` integer `n` and returns the count of set bits in `n` as an `i32`.\n",
    "2. **Loop through the Bits**: We use a while loop to check the bits of `n`. As long as `n` is greater than 0, we continue the loop.\n",
    "   - **Check LSB**: In each iteration, `num & 1` is used to check if the least significant bit is `1`. If it is, we increment the `count`.\n",
    "   - **Right-shift**: We then perform a right-shift (`num >>= 1`) to discard the checked bit.\n",
    "3. **Return the Count**: After the loop finishes, `count` will contain the number of `1` bits, and we return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: `n = 6` (binary representation: `110`)\n",
    "- First iteration: `n = 6`, LSB = 0 → no increment, right-shift to `n = 3`\n",
    "- Second iteration: `n = 3`, LSB = 1 → increment count to `1`, right-shift to `n = 1`\n",
    "- Third iteration: `n = 1`, LSB = 1 → increment count to `2`, right-shift to `n = 0`\n",
    "- Final count is `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: `n = 8` (binary representation: `1000`)\n",
    "- First iteration: `n = 8`, LSB = 0 → no increment, right-shift to `n = 4`\n",
    "- Second iteration: `n = 4`, LSB = 0 → no increment, right-shift to `n = 2`\n",
    "- Third iteration: `n = 2`, LSB = 0 → no increment, right-shift to `n = 1`\n",
    "- Fourth iteration: `n = 1`, LSB = 1 → increment count to `1`, right-shift to `n = 0`\n",
    "- Final count is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case when `n` is 0**: The number `0` has no set bits, so the function will return `0` immediately because the loop will not run (since `n > 0` is false).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Number of 1 bits in 6: 2\n",
    "Number of 1 bits in 8: 1\n",
    "```\n",
