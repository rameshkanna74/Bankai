    "To solve the problem of computing the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range `[left, right]`, we need to take into account some important observations and optimize the solution for large ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to compute the bitwise AND of all integers in the range `[left, right]` inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bitwise AND and Range**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the range is large, directly calculating the AND of all numbers would be inefficient.\n",
    "   - The bitwise AND operation only retains `1` bits at positions where all numbers in the range have `1` at that position. If there is any `0` at a bit position within the range, that position will be `0` in the result.\n",
    "   - As we move from `left` to `right`, the number of `1` bits in the result can only reduce (they can only turn to `0`). So if the range is large enough, certain bits will definitely be turned to `0` in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimizing the Solution**:\n",
    "   - Instead of calculating the AND for every number in the range, we can reduce the problem to finding the common prefix of the binary representations of `left` and `right`.\n",
    "   - If we keep right-shifting both `left` and `right` until they are equal, the result of the AND operation will be the common prefix of their binary representations shifted back to its original position.\n",
    "3. **Example Walkthrough**:\n",
    "   - If `left = 5` and `right = 7`, in binary:\n",
    "     - `5 = 101`\n",
    "     - `6 = 110`\n",
    "     - `7 = 111`\n",
    "   - The common prefix of `5` and `7` is `4` (binary `100`).\n",
    "   - Thus, `5 & 6 & 7 = 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will keep right-shifting both `left` and `right` until they become equal.\n",
    "2. For each shift, count the number of shifts, then shift the common value back to its original position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is **O(log(R - L))** because we are essentially reducing the problem to finding the common prefix of two numbers, and each shift operation divides the range size by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are only using a few integer variables and do not need additional data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn range_bitwise_and(left: i32, right: i32) -> i32 {\n",
    "        let mut left = left;\n",
    "        let mut right = right;\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Keep shifting both left and right until they are equal\n",
    "        let mut shift_count = 0;\n",
    "        while left != right {\n",

    "            shift_count += 1;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // After shifting, left == right, so shift it back to its original position\n",

    "    let right1 = 7;\n",
    "    println!(\"Bitwise AND of range [5, 7]: {}\", Solution::range_bitwise_and(left1, right1)); // Output: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Example 2:\n",
    "    let left2 = 0;\n",
    "    let right2 = 0;\n",
    "    println!(\"Bitwise AND of range [0, 0]: {}\", Solution::range_bitwise_and(left2, right2)); // Output: 0\n",

    "    println!(\"Bitwise AND of range [1, 2147483647]: {}\", Solution::range_bitwise_and(left3, right3)); // Output: 0\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`range_bitwise_and(left, right)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We initialize two mutable variables `left` and `right` to the input values.\n",
    "   - We then enter a `while` loop that continues until `left` equals `right`. In each iteration, both `left` and `right` are right-shifted by 1 bit. This effectively removes the differing bits from the rightmost positions, progressively narrowing down the range until both values are equal.\n",
    "   - The variable `shift_count` tracks the number of shifts that were performed.\n",
    "   - Once `left` and `right` are equal, we shift `left` back by `shift_count` positions to restore the value to its original bit-width.\n",
    "   - The final value of `left` after all shifts is the bitwise AND of the range `[left, right]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`main` function**:\n",
    "   - We run a few test cases to demonstrate the solution:\n",
    "     - `5` to `7` → output `4` (`5 & 6 & 7 = 4`).\n",
    "     - `0` to `0` → output `0` (`0 & 0 = 0`).\n",
    "     - `1` to `2147483647` → output `0` (as the range includes numbers that will turn the result to `0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: `left = 5`, `right = 7`\n",
    "- **Binary Representation**:\n",
    "  - `5 = 101`\n",
    "  - `6 = 110`\n",
    "  - `7 = 111`\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Shift `5` and `7` right until they are equal:\n",
    "    - `5 -> 2`, `7 -> 3` (after first shift)\n",
    "    - `2 -> 1`, `3 -> 1` (after second shift)\n",
    "  - They are now equal (`1`), and we shift `1` back by 2 positions to get `4`.\n",
    "- **Output**: `4`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: `left = 0`, `right = 0`\n",
    "- **Binary Representation**: `0 = 0000`\n",
    "- **Output**: `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: `left = 1`, `right = 2147483647`\n",
    "- **Binary Representation**: The numbers span a large range, and eventually, the AND result becomes `0` due to differences in the high-order bits.\n",
    "- **Output**: `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is optimal for the problem constraints, with a time complexity of **O(log(R - L))** and a space complexity of **O(1)**. The approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging bitwise shifts and the properties of the bitwise AND operation.\n"
