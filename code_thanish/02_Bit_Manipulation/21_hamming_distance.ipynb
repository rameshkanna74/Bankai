    "To solve the problem of calculating the **Hamming distance** between two integers `x` and `y`, we need to determine how many bits are different between the two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hamming distance** is defined as the number of bit positions at which two numbers differ.\n",
    "- The most efficient way to find the number of differing bits between two integers is by using the **XOR** operation (`^`).\n",
    "  - XOR between two bits produces `1` if the bits are different and `0` if they are the same.\n",
    "  - Thus, XORing the two integers will highlight the differing bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform a bitwise XOR between `x` and `y`. This will result in a number where each bit is `1` if the corresponding bits of `x` and `y` differ, and `0` otherwise.\n",
    "2. Count the number of `1`s in the result of the XOR operation. This count represents the Hamming distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **XOR** the two numbers: `diff = x ^ y`.\n",
    "2. Count the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of `diff`. This is equivalent to counting the differing bit positions between `x` and `y`.\n",
    "3. We can use a built-in method to count the number of `1` bits, such as `bit_count()` in Rust (which has an O(1) time complexity due to the fixed bit-width of integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(1)**: The time complexity is constant since the number of bits in the integers is fixed at 32 bits (for a 32-bit integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(1)**: We are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn hamming_distance(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {\n",
    "        // Perform XOR operation between x and y\n",
    "        let diff = x ^ y;\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Count the number of 1 bits in the result\n",
    "        diff.count_ones() as i32\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Test Case 1\n",
    "    let x1 = 1;\n",
    "    let y1 = 4;\n",
    "    println!(\"Hamming distance between {} and {}: {}\", x1, y1, Solution::hamming_distance(x1, y1));\n",
    "    // Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Test Case 2\n",
    "    let x2 = 3;\n",
    "    let y2 = 1;\n",
    "    println!(\"Hamming distance between {} and {}: {}\", x2, y2, Solution::hamming_distance(x2, y2));\n",
    "    // Output: 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **XOR Operation**:\n",
    "   - `let diff = x ^ y;`: This line performs the XOR operation between `x` and `y`. For each bit position, the result is `1` if the bits are different, and `0` if they are the same.\n",
    "2. **Counting the `1`s**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `diff.count_ones()`: This is a built-in Rust function that counts the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of the number. It's highly optimized and operates in constant time since we're dealing with a 32-bit integer.\n",
    "   - We cast the result to `i32` to match the return type of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main function**:\n",
    "   - We test the function with two sets of inputs:\n",
    "     - In the first test case, `x = 1` and `y = 4`. The XOR result will be `5` (`0101`), which has two `1` bits, so the output is `2`.\n",
    "     - In the second test case, `x = 3` and `y = 1`. The XOR result will be `2` (`0010`), which has one `1` bit, so the output is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: `x = 1`, `y = 4`\n",
    "  - Binary representation:\n",
    "    - `1` = `00000000000000000000000000000001`\n",
    "    - `4` = `00000000000000000000000000000100`\n",
    "  - XOR result: `00000000000000000000000000000101` (binary for 5)\n",
    "  - The number of `1` bits: 2\n",
    "- **Output**: `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: `x = 3`, `y = 1`\n",
    "  - Binary representation:\n",
    "    - `3` = `00000000000000000000000000000011`\n",
    "    - `1` = `00000000000000000000000000000001`\n",
    "  - XOR result: `00000000000000000000000000000010` (binary for 2)\n",
    "  - The number of `1` bits: 1\n",
    "- **Output**: `1`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is both time and space efficient with constant time complexity **O(1)** and constant space complexity **O(1)**. It uses the XOR operation to determine the differing bits and counts the number of `1`s in the XOR result using a built-in function in Rust, which is efficient and concise.\n"
