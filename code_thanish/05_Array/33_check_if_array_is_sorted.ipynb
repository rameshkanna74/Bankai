    "To solve the problem of checking whether an array is sorted in non-decreasing order, we can iterate through the array once and compare each element with the next one. If at any point an element is greater than the next, the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order, and we return `false`. If we go through the entire array without finding such a pair, we return `true`.\n",

    "- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array, since we make a single pass through the array.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`is_sorted` function**:\n",
    "   - **Input**: A slice `&[i32]` representing the array of integers.\n",
    "   - **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "   - **Step-by-Step**:\n",
    "     - We loop through the array from index `0` to `arr.len() - 2`, comparing each element with the next one.\n",
    "     - If any element is greater than the next one (i.e., `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`), we immediately return `false`, because this means the array is not sorted.\n",
    "     - If the loop completes without finding such a pair, we return `true`, indicating that the array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`main` function**:\n",
    "   - This function demonstrates the usage of `is_sorted` with two example arrays:\n",
    "     - `arr1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` which is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "     - `arr2 = [90, 80, 100, 70, 40, 30]` which is not sorted.\n",
    "   - The `println!` macro prints whether each array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Run Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Is arr1 sorted? true\n",
    "Is arr2 sorted? false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes:\n",
    "- **Edge cases**:\n",
    "  - If the array has only one element, it is trivially sorted (since there are no adjacent elements to compare), so the function will return `true`.\n",
    "  - The code works efficiently even for large arrays (up to the constraint of `10^6` elements).\n",
    "  - The algorithm handles both positive and negative integers because the comparison is based on simple integer values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is optimal in terms of both time and space, as we only traverse the array once and use a constant amount of space."
