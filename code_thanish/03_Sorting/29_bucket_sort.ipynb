    "Your implementation of the **Bucket Sort** algorithm looks mostly correct, but there are a few things to consider for improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Buckets Properly**:\n",
    "   - In the bucket assignment logic `buckets[len * *x / max].push(*x);`, you're calculating which bucket an element should go into, but you're also dividing by the `max` value. The approach works, but it needs refinement to ensure that elements are correctly placed in the right bucket.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Specifically, this line:\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   buckets[len * *x / max].push(*x);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   can be problematic, as integer division may result in elements getting placed in the wrong bucket if `x / max` is too small or too large. Instead, it would be better to use a floating point division and then floor the value or adjust the calculation so that it’s more stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bucket Size**:\n",
    "   - The number of buckets you're using is equal to the size of the input array (`len + 1`). Generally, the number of buckets can be based on the range of the input values rather than the array size itself. Typically, you use as many buckets as necessary to distribute the elements evenly across the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insertion Sort**:\n",
    "   - You're using `insertion_sort` from another module (`super::insertion_sort`). This is fine, but for the sake of completeness, I’ll assume you have an `insertion_sort` function elsewhere. You can also optimize the sorting part with a more efficient sorting algorithm if needed, but insertion sort is typically used in bucket sort when the bucket size is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a refined and optimized version of your `bucket_sort` implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimized Bucket Sort:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Changes & Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Bucket Index Calculation**:\n",
    "   - I adjusted the bucket index calculation to ensure that the elements are distributed evenly across the buckets. The formula:\n",
    "     ```rust\n",
    "     let index = (x - min) * (bucket_count - 1) / range;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ensures that the elements are placed in the correct bucket, even if the values vary across a wide range.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bucket Count Based on Array Size**:\n",
    "   - The number of buckets is set to the length of the array (`bucket_count = arr.len()`), which is a common choice when using bucket sort. This helps to distribute the elements more evenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Empty and Identical Arrays**:\n",
    "   - If the array is empty, we return an empty vector.\n",
    "   - If all elements in the array are identical (i.e., the `range` is zero), the array is already sorted, so we return it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient Sorting with `insertion_sort`**:\n",
    "   - The `insertion_sort` function sorts each individual bucket. This is fine for small buckets, as insertion sort performs well with small datasets. If your data contains many elements with large ranges, you might want to consider a more efficient sorting algorithm like merge sort or quicksort for each bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **Best and Average Case**: The time complexity is **O(n + k)**, where `n` is the number of elements and `k` is the number of buckets. Bucket sort performs well when the input elements are uniformly distributed across the buckets.\n",
    "- **Worst Case**: If all elements end up in the same bucket, the complexity could degrade to **O(n^2)**, which would happen if the input values are not uniformly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **O(n + k)**, as you're storing the input in multiple buckets (each of which can have up to `n` elements), plus the output array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "Sorted array: [1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation of bucket sort should now handle a broader range of inputs more efficiently while providing an optimized way to distribute the elements across buckets."
