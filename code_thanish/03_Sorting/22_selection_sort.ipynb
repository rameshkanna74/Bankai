    "### Selection Sort Algorithm in Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element. The algorithm iterates through the list, reducing the unsorted portion of the list by one after each iteration, until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at the beginning of the array.\n",
    "2. Find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array.\n",
    "3. Swap the smallest element found with the first element of the unsorted portion.\n",
    "4. Repeat this process for the rest of the array until it is fully sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best, Average, and Worst Case**: O(n²), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "  - In every iteration, you scan the unsorted portion of the array, which takes O(n) time, and there are `n` such iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(1)** because selection sort is an **in-place** sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require additional memory beyond the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation for Selection Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn selection_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>) {\n",
    "    let n = arr.len();\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Traverse through all array elements\n",
    "    for i in 0..n {\n",
    "        // Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array\n",
    "        let mut min_idx = i;\n",
    "        for j in (i + 1)..n {\n",
    "            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx] {\n",
    "                min_idx = j;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted portion\n",
    "        if min_idx != i {\n",
    "            arr.swap(i, min_idx);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Example test case\n",
    "    let mut arr = vec![64, 25, 12, 22, 11];\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"Original array: {:?}\", arr);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Sorting the array using selection sort\n",
    "    selection_sort(&mut arr);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Output the sorted array\n",
    "    println!(\"Sorted array: {:?}\", arr);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - `selection_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>)`: This function takes a mutable reference to a vector of integers (`arr`), which is the array to be sorted.\n",
    "2. **Outer Loop**:\n",
    "   - `for i in 0..n`: The outer loop goes through each element in the array. The variable `i` represents the starting index of the unsorted portion of the array.\n",
    "3. **Inner Loop**:\n",
    "   - `for j in (i + 1)..n`: The inner loop iterates over the unsorted portion of the array (elements to the right of the current element at index `i`) and finds the minimum element in that range.\n",
    "4. **Find Minimum Element**:\n",
    "   - `if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]`: If the current element is smaller than the element at the current minimum index, update `min_idx`.\n",
    "5. **Swap**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After the inner loop finishes, we swap the smallest element found in the unsorted portion with the element at index `i`.\n",
    "   - `arr.swap(i, min_idx)`: This swaps the elements at index `i` and `min_idx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Main Function**:\n",
    "   - In the `main` function, we create a vector of integers, print the original array, call the `selection_sort` function to sort the array, and then print the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input array `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`, the selection sort algorithm will work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Pass**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Find the smallest element from `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`, which is `11`.\n",
    "   - Swap `11` with `64`. The array becomes `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Pass**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Find the smallest element from `[25, 12, 22, 64]`, which is `12`.\n",
    "   - Swap `12` with `25`. The array becomes `[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third Pass**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Find the smallest element from `[25, 22, 64]`, which is `22`.\n",
    "   - Swap `22` with `25`. The array becomes `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fourth Pass**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Find the smallest element from `[25, 64]`, which is `25`.\n",
    "   - No need to swap as `25` is already in its correct place.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fifth Pass**:\n",
    "   - The array is already sorted, and no further actions are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Original array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n",
    "Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Rust implementation of the **selection sort** algorithm is a straightforward and efficient in-place sorting algorithm for small datasets. Its simplicity makes it an ideal teaching tool, although its O(n²) time complexity makes it less efficient for large datasets compared to more advanced sorting algorithms like **quick sort** or **merge sort**.\n"
