    "To solve the problem of finding the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two numbers efficiently, we can use the **Euclidean algorithm**, which has a time complexity of \\( O(\\log(\\min(a, b))) \\). This is the most optimal approach for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea:\n",
    "The Euclidean algorithm for GCD works on the principle that:\n",

    "\\[\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function `gcd`**:\n",
    "   - The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n",
    "   - We define two mutable variables `x` and `y` initialized with `a` and `b` respectively.\n",
    "   - The `while` loop continues as long as `y` is not zero.\n",
    "     - We store the value of `y` in a temporary variable `temp`.\n",
    "     - Then, we update `y` to the remainder of `x % y`.\n",
    "     - Finally, we update `x` to the value of `temp` (which was the old `y`).\n",
    "   - Once `y` becomes zero, the loop exits and `x` will be the GCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Function**:\n",
    "   - The `main` function demonstrates how the `gcd` function can be called with two integers, `a` and `b`.\n",
    "   - It prints the GCD of `a` and `b` using the `println!` macro.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- The time complexity of the Euclidean algorithm is \\( O(\\log(\\min(a, b))) \\), because in each step we reduce the problem size significantly by taking the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- The space complexity is \\( O(1) \\), because we only use a constant amount of space for storing intermediate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input values `a = 3` and `b = 6`, the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GCD of 3 and 6 is: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input values `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GCD of 1 and 1 is: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the function runs efficiently even for large values of `a` and `b` within the given constraints \\( 1 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^9 \\)."

    "3. **Performance:** The algorithm remains efficient with a time complexity of \\(O(\\log(\\min(a, b)))\\), which is optimal for GCD computation.\n",
