    "To solve the problem of counting the number of prime numbers strictly less than a given integer `n`, the most efficient approach is to use the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**. This algorithm can help us efficiently identify all prime numbers up to `n - 1` in \\( O(n \\log \\log n) \\) time, and then we can simply count how many `true` values remain in our prime array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Handling**: We need to handle cases where `n <= 1` directly, as there are no primes less than 2.\n",
    "2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:\n",
    "   - We will initialize a boolean array `is_prime` of size `n` where each index represents whether the number is prime or not.\n",
    "   - Mark `0` and `1` as non-prime.\n",
    "   - For each number `p` starting from 2, if `p` is still marked as prime, mark all of its multiples as non-prime.\n",
    "3. **Count Primes**: After the sieve process, we can count how many numbers are still marked as prime.\n",

    "### Time Complexity:\n",

    "### Explanation of Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edge Case**:\n",
    "   - If `n <= 2`, we immediately return `0` because there are no primes less than 2.\n",
    "2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We create a vector `is_prime` of size `n` initialized to `true`. We mark `0` and `1` as non-prime since by definition, neither `0` nor `1` are prime.\n",
    "   - For each number `p` starting from `2`, if `p` is still marked as prime, we mark all of its multiples starting from \\( p^2 \\) as non-prime.\n",
    "   - We only need to check for multiples of numbers up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), as any larger multiples will already have been marked by smaller primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Counting Primes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After applying the sieve, the `is_prime` vector will have `true` at all indices representing prime numbers.\n",
    "   - We use `.iter().filter(|&&x| x).count()` to count how many numbers are still marked as prime (`true`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return**:\n",
    "   - Finally, we return the count of prime numbers less than `n`.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Improved Readability**:\n",
    "   - Clear comments explain each step, making it easier to present and discuss during an interview.\n",
