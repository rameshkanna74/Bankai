    "The **Sieve of Eratosthenes** is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given number `n`. The idea behind the algorithm is to iteratively mark the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a boolean array** `is_prime` where each index represents whether the number at that index is prime.\n",
    "2. **Initialize** the array with `true` values, marking all numbers as potential primes. We know that 0 and 1 are not prime, so we set them to `false`.\n",
    "3. **Iterate from 2 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\)**: For each number `p` that is still marked as prime, mark all multiples of `p` as non-prime.\n",
    "4. **Return all indices** that are still marked as `true`, as they represent prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n \\log \\log n) \\), which is very efficient for large values of `n`.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\), since we need to maintain an array of size `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn sieve_of_eratosthenes(n: usize) -> Vec<usize> {\n",

    "    let primes1 = sieve_of_eratosthenes(n1);\n",
    "    println!(\"Primes less than or equal to {}: {:?}\", n1, primes1); // Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`sieve_of_eratosthenes(n: usize)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We initialize a boolean vector `is_prime` of size `n + 1` (to accommodate the index `n` itself).\n",
    "   - We start by marking `0` and `1` as non-prime, since they are not prime by definition.\n",
    "   - We iterate over all numbers from `2` to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). For each number `p`, if `p` is prime, we mark all multiples of `p` as non-prime by setting `is_prime[multiple] = false`.\n",
    "   - After the sieve process, we collect all the numbers that are still marked as prime and return them as a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`main()`**:\n",
    "   - In the `main` function, we test the sieve with two examples: `n = 10` and `n = 20`. The results are printed as vectors of prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: `n = 10`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Primes less than or equal to 10: [2, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: `n = 20`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Primes less than or equal to 20: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `n = 10`, the prime numbers are `[2, 3, 5, 7]`.\n",
    "- For `n = 20`, the prime numbers are `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This implementation is efficient, with a time complexity of \\( O(n \\log \\log n) \\), making it suitable for relatively large values of `n` (up to \\( 10^6 \\) or beyond). The space complexity is \\( O(n) \\), which is also efficient in terms of memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For `n = 1`**: No primes, so the function returns an empty vector.\n",
    "- **For `n = 2`**: Only `2` is prime, and the function returns `[2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code efficiently finds all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes in Rust.\n"
