    "The problem you're trying to solve is asking to find all possible subsets of a given array of unique integers, also known as the **power set**. We can generate subsets by using a variety of methods, but the most common and efficient way is by utilizing **backtracking** or by using **bitwise operations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a backtracking approach to generate all possible subsets. The idea is to recursively try to include or exclude each element in the set. Each time an element is included or excluded, we form a new subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtracking Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Decision**: For each element in the array:\n",
    "   - Include the element in the current subset.\n",
    "   - Exclude the element from the current subset.\n",
    "2. **Base Case**: Whenever we reach the end of the array, we record the current subset.\n",
    "3. **Solution Set**: The solution will be a collection of all these recorded subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with an empty subset and try to either include or exclude each number.\n",
    "2. Use a helper function to recursively explore all subsets.\n",
    "3. The recursive function will collect subsets in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The total number of subsets for a set of size `n` is \\( 2^n \\) because for each element, we have two choices: include it or exclude it.\n",
    "- Hence, the time complexity is \\( O(2^n) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a recursive call stack and store all subsets in a list, so the space complexity is also \\( O(2^n) \\).\n",

    "            for i in start..nums.len() {\n",
    "                current_subset.push(nums[i]); // include nums[i]\n",
    "                backtrack(nums, i + 1, current_subset, result); // explore the next elements\n",
    "                current_subset.pop(); // exclude nums[i] to try other subsets\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Start backtracking from index 0\n",
    "        backtrack(&nums, 0, &mut current_subset, &mut result);\n",

    "    let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];\n",
    "    let result = Solution::subsets(nums);\n",
    "    println!(\"{:?}\", result);  // Output: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case**:\n",
    "   - In the `backtrack` function, each time we reach a position in the array, we add the current subset to the result.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Step**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We start from the current index and either include the current element or exclude it.\n",
    "   - The loop iterates over the array starting from the current index to ensure each subset is generated in the correct order.\n",
    "   - The current element is added to the subset, and then the function is called recursively for the next element.\n",
    "   - After exploring, we remove the last element (`pop`) from the subset to backtrack and try the next possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result**:\n",
    "   - The `result` array will contain all the subsets, and it is returned once the recursion is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "For input `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, the recursive process generates the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially, `current_subset` is empty, and we start adding subsets.\n",
    "- We first consider including `1`:\n",
    "  - Current subset: `[1]`\n",
    "  - Then consider including `2`:\n",
    "    - Current subset: `[1, 2]`\n",
    "    - Then consider including `3`:\n",
    "      - Current subset: `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "      - After all elements, the recursion backtracks, and the subsets are collected.\n",
    "  - Then we exclude `3` and continue backtracking.\n",
    "  - We proceed similarly for `2` and `1` to explore all possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function returns the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Empty Input**: If `nums` is an empty array, the only subset is the empty subset: `[[]]`.\n",
    "2. **Single Element Input**: For a single element `nums = [x]`, the subsets are `[[], [x]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(2^n) \\) because we generate all subsets, and there are \\( 2^n \\) possible subsets for an array of size `n`.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(2^n) \\) for storing the subsets and the recursion stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient for the input size constraints, with \\( n \\leq 10 \\).\n"
