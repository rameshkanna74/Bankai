    "To solve this problem efficiently in Rust, we need to generate an array of length `n + 1` where each element represents the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of numbers from `0` to `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Representation**: The binary representation of numbers exhibits a regular pattern. If we know the number of set bits for a number `i`, we can compute it for `i + 1` using the previous result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimization Insight**: Instead of counting set bits for each number individually (which would be inefficient), we can use the relationship:\n",
    "   - `countBits(i) = countBits(i >> 1) + (i & 1)`\n",
    "   - This works because `i >> 1` essentially removes the least significant bit (LSB), and `(i & 1)` checks whether the LSB is 1. Thus, we can compute the number of set bits of `i` based on the result for `i >> 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start with an array `ans` of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros.\n",
    "- For each number `i` from `1` to `n`, we compute `ans[i]` using the relation `ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1)`.\n",
    "- This results in a **linear time complexity** solution: \\(O(n)\\), since we're iterating through the numbers once and using bitwise operations, which are constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), since we iterate through the numbers from `0` to `n` and each operation takes constant time.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), for the result array that stores the number of set bits for each number from `0` to `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn count_bits(n: i32) -> Vec<i32> {\n",
    "        // Create a vector to store the number of set bits for each number from 0 to n\n",
    "        let mut ans = vec![0; (n + 1) as usize];\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Iterate over each number from 1 to n\n",
    "        for i in 1..=n {\n",
    "            // The number of set bits in i is the same as the number of set bits in i >> 1,\n",
    "            // plus the current least significant bit (i & 1) if it's 1\n",
    "            ans[i as usize] = ans[(i >> 1) as usize] + (i & 1);\n",

    "\n",
    "    let result1 = Solution::count_bits(n1);\n",
    "    let result2 = Solution::count_bits(n2);\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"Number of set bits for n = {}: {:?}\", n1, result1); // Output: [0, 1, 1]\n",
    "    println!(\"Number of set bits for n = {}: {:?}\", n2, result2); // Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `let mut ans = vec![0; (n + 1) as usize];`: This initializes a vector `ans` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to `0`. This vector will store the number of set bits for each number from `0` to `n`.\n",
    "2. **Main Loop**:\n",
    "   - We iterate through each number `i` from `1` to `n`.\n",
    "   - For each `i`, we compute the number of set bits as follows:\n",
    "     - `ans[i as usize] = ans[(i >> 1) as usize] + (i & 1);`\n",
    "     - `i >> 1` shifts the bits of `i` to the right by 1, effectively dividing by 2. This gives us the number of set bits for the number `i` without the least significant bit.\n",
    "     - `(i & 1)` checks if the least significant bit of `i` is 1. If it is, it adds 1 to the count.\n",
    "3. **Return the Result**:\n",
    "   - Finally, the function returns the `ans` vector, which contains the number of set bits for each number from `0` to `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: `n = 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "- We initialize `ans = [0, 0, 0]` (length `3`).\n",
    "- For `i = 1`:\n",
    "  - `ans[1] = ans[1 >> 1] + (1 & 1) = ans[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`\n",
    "- For `i = 2`:\n",
    "  - `ans[2] = ans[2 >> 1] + (2 & 1) = ans[1] + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1`\n",
    "- Final result: `[0, 1, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: `n = 5`\n",
    "\n",
    "- We initialize `ans = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (length `6`).\n",
    "- For `i = 1`:\n",
    "  - `ans[1] = ans[1 >> 1] + (1 & 1) = ans[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`\n",
    "- For `i = 2`:\n",
    "  - `ans[2] = ans[2 >> 1] + (2 & 1) = ans[1] + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1`\n",
    "- For `i = 3`:\n",
    "  - `ans[3] = ans[3 >> 1] + (3 & 1) = ans[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n",
    "- For `i = 4`:\n",
    "  - `ans[4] = ans[4 >> 1] + (4 & 1) = ans[2] + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1`\n",
    "- For `i = 5`:\n",
    "  - `ans[5] = ans[5 >> 1] + (5 & 1) = ans[2] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n",
    "- Final result: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Number of set bits for n = 2: [0, 1, 1]\n",
    "Number of set bits for n = 5: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `n = 0`, the result should be `[0]`, as there are no set bits in `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is efficient with a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\) and a space complexity of \\(O(n)\\), which meets the problem's constraints and efficiently computes the number of set bits for all numbers from `0` to `n`.\n"
