    "To determine whether a number `n` is a power of two, we can use a very efficient approach by leveraging bitwise operations. The key observation is that powers of two have only **one bit set** to `1` in their binary representation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1` (which is `2^0`) is `0001` in binary.\n",
    "- `2` (which is `2^1`) is `0010` in binary.\n",
    "- `4` (which is `2^2`) is `0100` in binary.\n",
    "- `8` (which is `2^3`) is `1000` in binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general property of powers of two is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `n` is a power of two, the binary representation of `n` will have exactly **one bit** set to `1`.\n",
    "- If `n` is not a power of two, it will have more than one bit set to `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient Bitwise Trick:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take advantage of the following property:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a number `n` that is a power of two, the expression `n & (n - 1)` will be `0`.\n",
    "  - **Why?**: When you subtract `1` from `n`, it flips all the bits after the first `1` bit (starting from the rightmost side). The result of `n & (n - 1)` is `0` because `n` has exactly one `1` bit, and `n - 1` flips it and clears all the bits to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `n = 16` (`10000` in binary), `n - 1 = 15` (`01111` in binary), and `16 & 15 = 0`.\n",
    "- For `n = 3` (`0011` in binary), `n - 1 = 2` (`0010` in binary), and `3 & 2 = 2`, which is not `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we need to check if `n` is positive, because powers of two are positive numbers (i.e., we don't want to check negative numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl Solution {\n",
    "    pub fn is_power_of_two(n: i32) -> bool {\n",
    "        // Check if n is positive and if n & (n - 1) is 0\n",
    "        // This works only for powers of two\n",
    "        n > 0 && n & (n - 1) == 0\n",
    "    }\n",

    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // Test the solution with example cases\n",
    "\n",
    "    let test_case_1 = 1;\n",
    "    println!(\"Is {} a power of two? {}\", test_case_1, Solution::is_power_of_two(test_case_1));  // Output: true\n",
    "\n",
    "    let test_case_2 = 16;\n",
    "    println!(\"Is {} a power of two? {}\", test_case_2, Solution::is_power_of_two(test_case_2));  // Output: true\n",
    "\n",

    "    println!(\"Is {} a power of two? {}\", test_case_3, Solution::is_power_of_two(test_case_3));  // Output: false\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`n > 0`**: This ensures that we are checking only positive numbers. Negative numbers or zero can't be powers of two.\n",
    "- **`n & (n - 1) == 0`**: This checks if `n` is a power of two. If `n` is a power of two, this bitwise operation will result in `0`.\n",
    "- The solution uses constant space and executes in constant time (`O(1)`), making it very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(1) \\). The operation `n & (n - 1)` takes constant time, so the solution is constant-time.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(1) \\). We only use a few integer variables, so the space complexity is constant.\n",
