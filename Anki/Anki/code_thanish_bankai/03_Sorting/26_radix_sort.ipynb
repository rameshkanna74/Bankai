    "### Radix Sort in Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "**Radix Sort** is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that works by sorting the input numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD), or vice versa. It uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort the digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radix sort is efficient for sorting large sets of integers when the range of the numbers is not large, but the number of digits (or bits) is smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Radix sort works on individual digits of numbers, processing each digit separately.\n",
    "- It is often used with **base 10** (decimal) or **base 2** (binary), but it can be generalized to any base.\n",
    "- Radix sort works in **O(n \\* k)** time, where `n` is the number of elements and `k` is the number of digits in the largest number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Radix Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort the numbers based on the least significant digit (LSD).\n",
    "2. Use a stable sorting algorithm (like counting sort) to sort the numbers based on each digit.\n",
    "3. Repeat the process for all digits from least to most significant.\n",
    "4. Finally, the array will be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n \\* k), where `n` is the number of elements and `k` is the number of digits.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(n + k), for the output array and counting sort auxiliary space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust Code Implementation for Radix Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn counting_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>, exp: i32) {\n",
    "    let mut output = vec![0; arr.len()]; // Output array to store sorted elements\n",
    "    let mut count = vec![0; 10]; // Count array for digits (0-9)\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Count occurrences of each digit in the given place value (exp)\n",
    "    for &num in arr.iter() {\n",

    "        output[count[digit as usize] as usize - 1] = num;\n",
    "        count[digit as usize] -= 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Copy the sorted output array back to the original array\n",
    "    arr.copy_from_slice(&output);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn radix_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>) {\n",

    "    let max_val = *arr.iter().max().unwrap();\n",

    "    while max_val / exp > 0 {\n",

    "        exp *= 10; // Move to the next significant digit\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    let mut arr = vec![170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66];\n",
    "\n",
    "    println!(\"Original array: {:?}\", arr);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Sorting the array using Radix Sort\n",

    "\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Counting Sort Subroutine**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `counting_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>, exp: i32)` sorts the array based on the current digit represented by `exp` (1 for the ones place, 10 for the tens place, etc.).\n",
    "   - We create a `count` array to store the frequency of digits in the current place value.\n",
    "   - After counting the occurrences, we accumulate the counts to know the correct position of each digit.\n",
    "   - We then place the numbers in the correct position in the `output` array and copy the result back into the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Radix Sort**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `radix_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>)` is the main sorting function that repeatedly calls `counting_sort` for each digit.\n",
    "   - The `exp` (exponent) starts at 1, representing the least significant digit, and is multiplied by 10 after each pass to process the next more significant digit.\n",
    "   - The sorting continues until the maximum number (`max_val`) divided by `exp` is 0, meaning we have processed all digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Function**:\n",
    "   - The `main()` function demonstrates the usage of Radix Sort by creating an array, printing it, sorting it, and then printing the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input array `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`, the sorting will happen as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pass 1** (sort by least significant digit):\n",
    "\n",
    "  - After sorting by the units place (0s, 1s, 2s...): `[170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pass 2** (sort by tens place):\n",
    "\n",
    "  - After sorting by the tens place (0s, 10s, 20s...): `[802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pass 3** (sort by hundreds place):\n",
    "  - After sorting by the hundreds place (0s, 1s, 2s...): `[2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The array is now sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Original array: [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]\n",
    "Sorted array: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Radix Sort is a very efficient algorithm when the range of numbers is small or when the number of digits is small. However, if the range of numbers is very large, or if sorting strings or non-integer data types, other algorithms such as MergeSort or QuickSort might be more appropriate.\n"
