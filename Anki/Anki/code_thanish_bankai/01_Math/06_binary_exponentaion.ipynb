    "The variation of **Binary Exponentiation** for multiplying two numbers modulo `m` can be implemented in Rust using the technique of **exponentiation by squaring**, but instead of traditional multiplication, we'll perform the operation with modular arithmetic to avoid overflow. This allows us to compute the product of two large numbers modulo `m` without having to deal with large intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to compute \\( a \\times b \\mod m \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are large numbers, and their product is too large to fit in a typical 64-bit integer. We can solve this using the binary exponentiation technique, adjusted for multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If `a` is even, we can halve it and double the multiplication result.\n",
    "2. If `a` is odd, we subtract one from `a`, halve it, and multiply the result by `b` one additional time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to compute the product modulo `m` in \\( O(\\log a) \\) time, which is much more efficient than directly multiplying large numbers.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Initialize `res`**: We start with `res = 0` to accumulate the result of the multiplication.\n",
    "- **Step 2: Handle `a` and `b`**:\n",
    "  - We first reduce `a` modulo `m` to ensure that the value doesn't overflow as we process it.\n",
    "  - Then, for each bit of `b`, we check if it's odd. If it is, we add the current value of `a` to `res`, then double `a` and halve `b`. The doubling of `a` corresponds to shifting its position in the binary representation of `b` (equivalent to multiplying by powers of 2).\n",
    "- **Step 3: Loop until `b` becomes 0**: The loop continues until we've processed all the bits of `b`. At each iteration, we either add `a` to `res` (if the current bit of `b` is 1) and update `a` and `b` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4: Return the result**: After the loop finishes, `res` contains the result of \\( a \\times b \\mod m \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is \\( O(\\log b) \\), because in each iteration, `b` is halved. Thus, the number of iterations is logarithmic with respect to `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is \\( O(1) \\), since we're only using a constant amount of extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "For `a = 123456789`, `b = 987654321`, and `m = 1000000007`:\n",
