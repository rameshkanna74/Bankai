    "To solve the problem of counting the number of prime numbers strictly less than a given integer `n`, the most efficient approach is to use the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**. This algorithm can help us efficiently identify all prime numbers up to `n - 1` in \\( O(n \\log \\log n) \\) time, and then we can simply count how many `true` values remain in our prime array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Input Handling**: We need to handle cases where `n <= 1` directly, as there are no primes less than 2.\n",
    "2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:\n",
    "   - We will initialize a boolean array `is_prime` of size `n` where each index represents whether the number is prime or not.\n",
    "   - Mark `0` and `1` as non-prime.\n",
    "   - For each number `p` starting from 2, if `p` is still marked as prime, mark all of its multiples as non-prime.\n",
    "3. **Count Primes**: After the sieve process, we can count how many numbers are still marked as prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n \\log \\log n) \\) for the sieve algorithm.\n",

    "### Explanation of Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edge Case**:\n",
    "   - If `n <= 2`, we immediately return `0` because there are no primes less than 2.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:\n",
    "   - We create a vector `is_prime` of size `n` initialized to `true`. We mark `0` and `1` as non-prime since by definition, neither `0` nor `1` are prime.\n",
    "   - For each number `p` starting from `2`, if `p` is still marked as prime, we mark all of its multiples starting from \\( p^2 \\) as non-prime.\n",
    "   - We only need to check for multiples of numbers up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), as any larger multiples will already have been marked by smaller primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Counting Primes**:\n",
    "   - After applying the sieve, the `is_prime` vector will have `true` at all indices representing prime numbers.\n",
    "   - We use `.iter().filter(|&&x| x).count()` to count how many numbers are still marked as prime (`true`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return**:\n",
    "   - Finally, we return the count of prime numbers less than `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: `n = 10`\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Number of primes less than 10: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The primes less than 10 are `2, 3, 5, 7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: `n = 0`\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Number of primes less than 0: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: No primes less than `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: `n = 1`\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Number of primes less than 1: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: No primes less than `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **Sieve of Eratosthenes** has a time complexity of \\( O(n \\log \\log n) \\), which is efficient for large values of `n`, like `5 * 10^6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\), since we need to store the `is_prime` vector for all numbers from `0` to `n-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution efficiently counts the number of prime numbers less than `n` while handling the constraints effectively."
