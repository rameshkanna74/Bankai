    "1. **`count_factors(n: i32) -> i32`**:\n",
    "   - We initialize `divisor_count` to keep track of the total number of divisors.\n",
    "   - We iterate through all integers `i` from 1 to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\). If `i` divides `N` evenly, we increment the divisor count.\n",
    "   - We check if `i` is equal to \\( \\frac{N}{i} \\) (in case of perfect squares), and if so, we avoid double-counting that divisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`main()` function**:\n",
    "   - For demonstration, we run two examples (`N = 5` and `N = 25`) and print the results.\n",
    "   - The user is prompted to enter a number, and the program calculates and prints the number of divisors for that input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "5\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Number of divisors of 5: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, so the output is 2.\n",

    "Input:\n",
    "25\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Number of divisors of 25: 3\n",

    "### Performance:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(\\sqrt{N}) \\)\n",
    "  - The loop runs at most \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) times, making the solution efficient even for large values of `N` (up to 100,000).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(1) \\)\n",
