    "\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic **recursive problem** in **divide and conquer**. Given `n` disks and three pegs (source, auxiliary, target), our goal is to move all `n` disks from the source peg to the target peg using the auxiliary peg, following these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "2. A disk can only be placed on an empty peg or a larger disk.\n",
    "3. The minimum number of moves required is **\\(2^n - 1\\)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Optimal Time & Space Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: **O(2^n)**\n",
    "  - The recurrence relation follows \\(T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1\\), which solves to \\(T(n) = 2^n - 1\\).\n",
    "  - This is the best we can do, as every move is necessary.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**\n",
    "  - The recursion depth reaches **\\(O(n)\\)** due to function call stack usage.\n",
