    "We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.\n",

    "\n",
    "We need to determine the **minimum number of days** required to make `m` bouquets, where each bouquet consists of `k` adjacent flowers from the `bloomDay` array.  \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **If `m * k > n`, it's impossible to make `m` bouquets**\n",
    "   - Since `n` is the total number of flowers, if we need `m * k` flowers and `n` is smaller, return `-1` immediately.\n",
    "2. **Binary Search on `days` is optimal**\n",
    "   - The **earliest** possible day is `min(bloomDay)`, and the **latest** is `max(bloomDay)`.\n",
    "   - We can use **Binary Search** to efficiently find the **smallest day** when we can make `m` bouquets.\n",

    "## 🚀 **Algorithm Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Key Idea: Binary Search on Days**\n",
    "\n",
    "We search for the **minimum `days`** that allows making `m` bouquets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lower Bound (`low`)**: The smallest day any flower blooms (`min(bloomDay)`).\n",
    "2. **Upper Bound (`high`)**: The latest day a flower blooms (`max(bloomDay)`).\n",
    "3. **Binary Search**:\n",
    "   - For `mid = (low + high) / 2`, check **if we can make `m` bouquets** using flowers that bloom on or before `mid`.\n",
    "   - If possible, **try earlier days** (`high = mid`).\n",
    "   - Otherwise, **increase `mid`** (`low = mid + 1`).\n",
    "4. **Stopping Condition**: `low == high`, which gives the **minimum possible day**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 How to Check if We Can Make `m` Bouquets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We iterate through `bloomDay`:\n",
    "  - Count **consecutive bloomed flowers** (`bloomDay[i] <= mid`).\n",
    "  - If we get `k` adjacent bloomed flowers, we **form a bouquet**.\n",
