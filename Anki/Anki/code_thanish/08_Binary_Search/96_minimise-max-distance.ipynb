    "### Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a sorted array ‚Äòarr‚Äô of length ‚Äòn‚Äô, which contains positive integer positions of ‚Äòn‚Äô gas stations on the X-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given an integer ‚Äòk‚Äô.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to place 'k' new gas stations on the X-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can place them anywhere on the non-negative side of the X-axis, even on non-integer positions.\n",

    "Let 'dist' be the maximum value of the distance between adjacent gas stations after adding 'k' new gas stations.\n",

    "We can place 6 gas stations at 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5.\n",

    "1. **Binary Search on `dist` (the maximum adjacent gap):**\n",

    "   - The **largest possible `dist`** is `arr[n-1] - arr[0]` (if no stations are added).\n",
    "   - We need to **binary search on `dist`** to find the smallest feasible value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Checking Feasibility (`can_place` function using Greedy approach):**\n",
    "   - Given a candidate `dist`, determine if **at most `k` stations** can be added such that no adjacent distance exceeds `dist`.\n",
