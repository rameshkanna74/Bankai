    "\n",
    "We are given **N stalls** located at different positions along a straight line and **C cows** that need to be placed in the stalls.  \n",

    "### **Key Observations**\n",

    "- The stalls are at arbitrary positions, so **sorting them helps define a clear placement strategy**.\n",
    "- The minimum possible distance (`low`) is **1** (placing cows in consecutive stalls).\n",
