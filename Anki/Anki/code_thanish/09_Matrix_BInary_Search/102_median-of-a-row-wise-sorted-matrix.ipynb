    "3. **Optimal Approach (Binary Search)**\n",
    "   - Since the matrix is **row-wise sorted**, we can apply **binary search on values** (not indices).\n",
    "   - The **median** must be the `k = (m * n) / 2`-th smallest element.\n",
    "   - **Efficiently count how many elements are ‚â§ `x`** using **binary search in each row**.\n",
