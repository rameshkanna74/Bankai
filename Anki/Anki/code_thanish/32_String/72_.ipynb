    "- Minimize extra space usage and explain the space complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ **Rust Code Quality**  \n",
    "- Use **clean, idiomatic, modular Rust code** suitable for **FAANG/MAANG interviews**.  \n",
    "- Follow **ownership, borrowing, and iterator best practices**.  \n",
    "- Include **realistic interview-level function signatures** (`fn solve(...) -> ...`).  \n",
    "- Avoid unnecessary `unwrap()`, `expect()`, or unsafe code unless clearly justified.  \n",
    "- Handle all **edge cases** thoughtfully within the code.  \n",
    "- Provide **unit tests** (`#[test]`) for common and edge cases.  \n",

    "ðŸ”¹ **Algorithm Explanation**  \n",
    "- Describe the **core DSA concepts** used (e.g., Greedy, DP, Binary Search).  \n",
    "- Explain the **algorithm design, reasoning**, and why this is the most optimal approach.  \n",
    "- Discuss any **critical trade-offs** made.  \n",

    "ðŸ”¹ **Constraints & Scalability**  \n",
    "- Analyze the solution's behavior under **maximum input sizes**.  \n",
    "- Confirm it passes **stress tests** without significant performance degradation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ **DSA Tags**  \n",
    "- Suggest relevant DSA topics (e.g., Arrays, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Sliding Window).  \n",
