    "Today, I returned to work after a long break. I started my workday at 9:55 AM and began a new project in Escriptorium. My task was to perform segmentation on 10 images. I learned how to do this using Escriptorium and its keyboard shortcuts. The process begins by drawing the region and baseline for each image. Once these steps are completed for all the images, I select them all and run the \"Redraw Mask\" for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the mask generation, I reviewed the generated masks to ensure accuracy. The next step is manual transcription, but since today was my first day, I only managed to complete 10 images. I then exported the data as an Alto file and attempted to create a segmentation model using the \"Ketos\" command-line tool, but it didn't work. I'm not sure why it failed, but then I decided to try the model training feature in Escriptorium. To my surprise, it worked! I got a 44% accuracy on the segmentation model for the images. While this may seem like a small win, it's still a win, and Iâ€™m proud of it. I need to keep learning and understanding Escriptorium more deeply to improve.\n",

    "After work, I went home and played **Factorio**. I was having a blast in the Planet Gleba scenario. The new Space Age update is so much fun, and Iâ€™ve already invested almost 200 hours in the game. It was a nice break after a productive day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, I did my **Anki review** and completed a couple of problems on **LeetCode**. The fun continued from there. Around 11:00 PM, I realized that my internet data pack was about to expire the next day. I only had one hour left, and I needed to make the most out of my remaining data.
