        "### Nice to meet you, my name is Ramesh Kanna. I came from Puducherry, India. He currently specializes in backend development, with a particular focus on developing REST APIs using Python using Django and the Django Rest Framework. We also have extensive experience designing databases and optimizing performance using PostgreSQL. Previously, he was responsible for back-end development of OCR API integration applications and e-learning platforms, and also focused on security enhancements such as implementing user authentication and role-based access control. In particular, we focus on API design that leverages Django and the Django Rest Framework, and improves application scalability using Docker and CI/CD pipelines to ensure maintainability and scalability of complex systems. My strength is in designing code that is efficient and extensible. Through his work, he has successfully developed a system that processes a large amount of image data by tuning database performance and integrating multiple OCR services such as EasyOCR, Google Document AI, and Azure OCR. He is also currently focusing on learning Rust, deepening his understanding of algorithms and data structures through more than 200 problems solved in LeetCode. In addition to technical skills, I am also good at communicating smoothly with the team. I work closely with my team members to help them move forward with the project, from requirements definition to implementation and testing. I'm currently studying Japanese, but I've got NAT-3 and have no problem with everyday conversation. In the future, I will continue to improve my Japanese and strive to actively contribute to your company's projects. Finally, I aim to further improve my technical skills through my career in Japan and look forward to the opportunity to work for your company. Thank you very much.\n",

I’m truly grateful to AppXperts for giving me my first job as a Junior Software Engineer. It was an invaluable experience that taught me a lot about software development, working in a team, and building real-world applications. I will always be thankful to my team leader, K. Sundar, and my colleagues at AppXperts for their mentorship and support. They helped me realize my potential and set the foundation for my career in software development.\n",

        "However, at that point in my life, I had a clear goal of moving to Japan. To do that, I knew I needed to be fluent in Japanese and more proficient than what the JLPT N3 level could offer. I was determined to pursue a bilingual engineering career in Japan, and to achieve that, I needed to immerse myself in the language and culture. I researched and found **Nihon Edu Tech**, a Japanese language school in Chennai, which could help me reach my goal. After visiting them, I learned that for an engineer visa and to work as a software developer in Japan, a higher level of Japanese proficiency was crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this in mind, I made the decision to focus on learning Japanese. I discussed my plans with my team leader and HR at AppXperts, and I resigned from my position to dedicate myself to language learning. Unfortunately, due to an emergency situation in my family, I was unable to join Nihon Edu Tech and had to shift to self-study. \n",

        "Despite facing setbacks, I didn’t give up. I continued my Japanese learning journey through self-study and took the **NAT 4Q** exam in August 2023, followed by the **NAT 3Q** exam in October 2024. Although I didn’t pass these exams, they were valuable learning experiences that kept me motivated.\n",

Their small team required my skills, and I joined them in December 2023.

Calisthenics is perfect for me because it doesn’t require a gym or equipment, and I can do it anytime, anywhere—at home, in the park, or even during a break at work. It not only helps me stay physically fit but also boosts my confidence and mental clarity, which are essential when working on complex problems in tech. \n",
